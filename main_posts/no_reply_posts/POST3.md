# my brain was completely fried from cheap dopamine and I didn't even realize it (how I fixed it)

25M here. gonna be honest - I had undiagnosed ADHD for years and basically "self-medicated" with constant stimulation. porn, video games, junk food, weed, scrolling... basically any activity that gave me a quick hit of dopamine

The problem? **My brain got so used to cheap dopamine that I literally couldn't do anything that required effort anymore.**

Trying to read a book? Impossible. Studying? Forget it. Even watching a full movie without checking my phone felt physically painful.

I thought I was just lazy or broken or didn't have discipline. 

Turns out I'd just completely destroyed my dopamine receptors.

## here's what happened (the science part)

I'm a psych student so when I finally looked into this I went deep

Dopamine isn't actually the "pleasure" chemical like everyone thinks - **it's the "wanting" and "motivation" chemical**

When you do high-dopamine activities (scrolling TikTok, eating junk food, watching porn, playing video games), your brain gets FLOODED with dopamine. Way more than anything in nature would give you.

Do that consistently and your brain adapts by **reducing dopamine receptors**

Fewer receptors = lower motivation, worse concentration, less mental sharpness, everything feels boring

This is why there are more college dropouts than ever. More people unhappy at work. More depression cases.

**Our brains weren't designed for this level of constant stimulation.**

And big companies KNOW this. They engineer their apps and foods to hit the exact dopamine sweet spot that keeps you coming back.

## the cheap vs hard dopamine framework

This changed how I see everything:

**CHEAP DOPAMINE:**
- Scrolling social media  
- Netflix binges
- Junk food
- Porn
- Weed/alcohol
- Video games (designed to be addictive)

→ Instant hit, no effort required, doesn't build anything

**HARD DOPAMINE:**
- Exercise
- Finishing actual work
- Learning something difficult  
- Long-term goals
- Creative projects
- Getting stuff done

→ Delayed reward, requires effort, builds your life

**Here's the thing: ADHD brains (and overstimulated normal brains) will ALWAYS choose cheap over hard.**

Like always. It's not a willpower issue - your brain is literally wired to take the path of least resistance to dopamine.

The only solution? **Eliminate ALL cheap dopamine sources so your brain is forced to seek the hard stuff.**

## what I actually did (no magic bullets)

**Phase 1: The Elimination (first 2 weeks)**

I went nuclear. Like scorched earth policy.

- Deleted Instagram, TikTok, Twitter apps (didn't delete accounts, just removed apps from phone)
- Bought a lockbox for my phone (the kind without emergency open - once it's in there, it's in there)
- Moved my gaming PC to my basement (added enough friction that I stopped gaming)
- Threw out all junk food
- Completely quit porn (this was the hardest one fr)

Those first two weeks were BRUTAL. I felt anxious, restless, bored out of my mind.

**But that boredom? That's not a problem. That boredom is the cure.**

When you're bored and have no easy dopamine source, your brain goes "well I guess we gotta do something" and suddenly those "hard" activities don't seem as hard.

**Phase 2: Building replacement habits (weeks 3-8)**

Once I'd cleared out the cheap dopamine, I had to fill that time with something

I started stupidly small:
- 20 minute walks (no headphones, just thinking)
- 5 minutes of meditation (just sitting there, letting my brain calm down)
- Reading for 10 minutes (actually finishing books for the first time in years)

The key was starting SO SMALL I couldn't fail

Because here's what people don't get: **you can't go from 0 to 100.**

Only an idiot would walk into a gym and immediately try to bench press 300 pounds, right? Same with your brain.

If your focus muscle is completely atrophied from years of scrolling, you can't suddenly expect to study for 4 hours straight.

Start with 5 minutes. Then 10. Then 15. Build the muscle over weeks.

**Phase 3: Training focus (ongoing)**

This is where it clicked for me:

**Focus is supposed to be painful. That pain means it's working.**

When you're trying to concentrate and your brain is like "this is uncomfortable, let's check Reddit" - that discomfort is the GROWTH.

Like workout pain. People who lift heavy actually enjoy the burn because they know it means they're getting stronger.

Same with focus. The more you practice sitting with that discomfort, the better you get at it.

I started using 30-minute timer sessions:
- Set timer for 30 min
- Work like an absolute madman on one task
- 10 min break (no screens, just walk around or stretch)  
- Repeat

After 4-6 cycles my brain is cooked but I've gotten more done than I used to in full days.

**The timer creates artificial urgency.** I'm not just "working whenever I feel like it" - I'm on the clock, zero distractions, pressure of the deadline.

It works goddamn wonders every time.

## the stuff that actually helped me stick with it

**Environmental design**

I stopped relying on willpower and just made the right choices automatic:

- Phone charges in different room (not next to bed)
- Two separate browsers: Safari for work, Chrome for entertainment (my subconscious knows when I open Safari it's work time)
- Only keep healthy food in the house (can't eat junk if it's not there)
- Cold Turkey app to block distracting sites 10am-midnight (can't override it)

**Never work where you relax, never relax where you work**

This might be the most important thing I learned

I ONLY work at coffee shops or the library now. Never at home.

Something about the physical separation tells my brain "this is focus mode" and I can actually get into deep work

When I'm home, I can fully relax because I don't associate it with work stress

**The "never miss twice" rule**

I still have bad days. Days where I scroll for hours or eat like shit or skip my walk

That's fine. Life happens.

But I NEVER let it become two days in a row.

One bad day is a blip. Two bad days is the start of a pattern.

**50% effort is infinitely better than 0% effort.**

**Fasting for focus**

This one sounds weird but I'm way more productive on an empty stomach

I do my best work before lunch. Once I eat a big meal, especially carb-heavy, my brain is basically done for the day.

Intermittent fasting during my first 8 productive hours, then eating after the hard work is done.

## where I'm at now (6 months later)

Not gonna lie, it's not perfect. I still have ADHD, I still struggle with focus sometimes.

But compared to where I was?

- I can actually read books now (finished 15 in the last 6 months)
- My grades went from Cs and Ds to mostly As and Bs  
- I have energy for the first time in years
- Lost 20 pounds without really trying (just stopped eating junk while scrolling)
- Started a side project that's actually making money
- Got into my first real relationship (turns out being able to have a conversation without checking your phone helps lol)

The biggest change isn't even the external stuff though

**It's that I trust myself again.**

When I say "I'm gonna do this," I actually believe myself now. Because I've proven to myself over and over that I can keep promises to myself.

That self-trust is worth more than any productivity hack.

One thing that genuinely helped was tracking my focus sessions and streaks with [this habit app](https://sat.curiolearn.co/resovel) - something about seeing "47-day streak" on my morning walk habit makes me not want to break it. Stupid simple but our brains like seeing progress.

## if you're in the same boat I was

First: check if you might have ADHD. Seriously. Get tested.

Knowledge that your brain is actually different (not broken, just different) helps you find solutions that work for you specifically.

Second: **your "addictive personality" is actually a blessing if you redirect it**

We're very good at getting obsessed with things. The problem is when those things are porn, video games, and social media.

But you can get equally addicted to good things.  I'm now lowkey addicted to my morning walks, to reading, to finishing work sprints. 

Same brain wiring, better targets.

Third: **elimination works better than moderation for some people**

If you have ADHD or terrible impulse control (like me), "just use social media in moderation" doesn't work.

It's like telling an alcoholic "just have one drink." Our brains don't work like that.

Complete elimination is actually easier because there's no decision to make.

---

This got way longer than I meant it to lol but if even one person reads this and realizes their brain isn't broken, it's just overstimulated, and that can be fixed - worth it

You're not lazy. You're not weak. Your brain is just running on shit fuel.

Switch to premium and see what happens.

**TL;DR:** Years of cheap dopamine (porn, games, scrolling, junk food) destroyed my ability to focus or feel motivated. Learned about dopamine regulation, went nuclear on eliminating all cheap dopamine sources, started absurdly small with hard dopamine activities, trained focus like a muscle using timers. 6 months later can actually read, focus, and trust myself again. Cheap dopamine = instant but hollow. Hard dopamine = delayed but builds your life.
