# what my 96-year-old grandma taught me about discipline (that actually worked)

22M. this is gonna sound weird but the best productivity advice I ever got was from my grandma who lived through WW2

I was complaining to her about how I couldn't get myself to do anything - had a job and school but also just felt completely stuck, scrolling for hours every day, starting projects and never finishing them, "wanting" to be better but never actually changing

she just looked at me and said:

**"You need to separate your actions from your feelings."**

I was like what? And she continued:

"During the war, I didn't *feel like* rationing food, but I did it anyway. I didn't *feel like* working in the factory, but I did it anyway. Not because I ignored my feelings. Because I did it WITH my feelings."

That completely changed how I think about discipline.

## what most people get wrong about discipline

Everyone thinks discipline means:
- Wake up at 5am feeling amazing and energized
- Hit the gym with perfect motivation  
- Work for 8 hours in flow state
- Have a perfect evening routine

That's not discipline. **That's cosplaying discipline for Instagram.**

Real discipline is:
- "I don't feel like working out. I'll work out anyway."
- "I'm stressed about this assignment. I'll do it while stressed."  
- "I'm tired and unmotivated. I'll start anyway and see what happens."

**The narrative most people tell themselves:**
"I'm anxious, so I *can't* study today"
"I'm tired, so I *can't* go to the gym"  
"I'm not motivated, so I *can't* work on my project"

**The narrative shift that changed my life:**
"I'm anxious, so I'll study while anxious"
"I'm tired, so I'll work out tired"
"I'm unmotivated, so I'll work unmotivated"

You don't wait to feel good to do what needs doing. You do it anyway.

## the problem isn't doing - it's starting

I realized something: once I actually START the thing, it's usually fine

It's getting from the couch to putting on gym shoes that's hard. Once I'm at the gym, the workout happens.

It's opening the laptop and starting the first sentence that's hard. Once I'm writing, words come out.

**So I made STARTING absurdly easy by making the requirement ridiculously small**

Old approach: "I'm gonna study for 3 hours today"
→ Brain: "That sounds exhausting, let's scroll instead"

New approach: "I'm gonna open my textbook and read one paragraph"  
→ Brain: "...okay that's doable I guess"

And here's what happens: once you read that one paragraph, you usually read more. Not always, but usually.

**But even if you only read one paragraph, you kept the promise you made to yourself.**

And THAT is what discipline actually is.

## discipline = closing the gap between what you said and what you did

This reframed everything for me

Discipline isn't about having perfect habits or a color-coded schedule or a 5am morning routine

**Discipline is closing the gap between what you said you'd do and what you actually do**

- Say you'll go to the gym → go to the gym = +1 self-trust
- Say you'll go to the gym → don't go = -1 self-trust  

Every promise you keep builds self-respect. Every promise you break trains your brain not to believe you.

**Once you stop trusting yourself, it's game over.**

When I say "I'll do it tomorrow" and then don't, I'm teaching myself that my word means nothing.

But when I say "I'll write for 10 minutes" and I do it, even if it's garbage writing, I'm teaching myself that I keep my word.

Over weeks and months, that compounds into actual self-discipline.

## what actually worked for me (the boring stuff)

**1. Made my habits so small I couldn't fail**

I'm talking STUPID small:

- Drink one glass of water when I wake up  
- Walk outside for 10 minutes
- Write three things I'm grateful for

That's it. Those were my only "non-negotiables" for the first month.

Everyone told me "that's not enough to make a difference" but here's the thing:

**You're not trying to make a difference. You're trying to build self-trust.**

Once I proved to myself I could actually keep tiny promises, I added slightly bigger ones. Then bigger.

Now (8 months later) my non-negotiables are:
- 30 min walk
- 30 min reading  
- Two 45-min focus sessions on my most important task
- Evening journal

But I built up to that over MONTHS. Not weeks. Months.

**2. The "never miss twice" rule saved me from spirals**

I still have bad days. Days where I don't feel like doing anything and just scroll.

Old me would think: "I already ruined today, might as well make it a full cheat day. I'll start fresh Monday."

And Monday comes and I do the same thing. And suddenly it's been three weeks.

New me: **Never miss twice.**

One bad day is fine. Life happens. But I REFUSE to let it become two days in a row.

Miss my morning walk Monday? I WILL walk Tuesday, no excuses.

**50% effort is infinitely better than 0% effort** because it keeps the habit alive.

**3. Rigged my environment so discipline was easier**

I stopped relying on willpower and just removed distractions:

- Phone charges in the kitchen (not my bedroom)
- Deleted social media apps (can still access on computer, but adds friction)
- Gym bag packed and by the door the night before
- Guitar out of the case in my living room (I trip over it and end up playing lol)

**You don't need motivation. You need a rigged environment.**

Making the right choice automatic means you don't waste mental energy resisting temptation all day.

**4. Used timers to create artificial urgency**

This one is stupid effective

30-minute timer for focused work → 10-minute break (no screens) → repeat

When that timer is running, I work like an absolute madman because I know:
- It's ONLY 30 minutes (my brain can handle that)
- I get a break after  
- I'm racing the clock

After 4-6 cycles my brain is fried but I've done more than I used to accomplish in full days of "productive procrastination"

**5. Tracked my wins to make progress visible**

I started tracking two things:
- My daily "non-negotiables" (did I do my 3 small habits?)
- My focus sessions (how many 30-min sprints did I complete?)

Something about SEEING the streak build makes you not want to break it

I use [this app my friend recommended](https://arhamamin.com/resolve) that shows like a GitHub-style grid of your habits - empty squares when you miss, filled when you hit them

Sounds dumb but our monkey brains like seeing the squares fill up. 47-day streak? I'm not breaking that over one day of not feeling like it.

## the first 8 hours after waking are everything

One thing I learned: **your willpower isn't unlimited, and it's strongest in the morning**

Dopamine resets when you sleep, so the first 8 hours after waking are when your brain is most capable of focus and discipline

After that? Your body naturally lowers adrenaline and increases serotonin. You get tired. Self-control drops.

This is NORMAL. Not a failure.

So here's what I do:

**First 8 hours (my productive window):**
- No phone for the first hour
- Two 45-min focus sessions on hardest tasks  
- Workouts, reading, anything that requires discipline

**After 8 hours:** 
- Emails, easy tasks, relaxing
- Give myself permission to "let loose a little bit" because I already used my peak hours

Trying to be disciplined all 16 waking hours is exhausting and leads to burnout.

**Use your peak hours for peak work. Give yourself permission to coast after.**

## what changed (7 months later)

I'm not gonna pretend I'm some productivity guru now. I still procrastinate sometimes. Still have days where I don't feel like doing anything.

But:

- I trust myself now (when I say I'll do something, I actually believe I will)
- Finished my degree  
- Working out 4-5x per week (was zero before)
- Reading 2-3 books per month
- Started a small online business (not huge but it EXISTS)
- Sleep schedule is fixed (10pm-6am instead of 2am-10am)
- Way less anxious overall

The external changes are cool but honestly THE biggest difference is internal:

**I respect myself now because I keep my word to myself**

That self-respect is the foundation everything else is built on.

## if you're where I was 7 months ago

You're probably doing better than you think. If you have a job, school, and awareness that you're stuck - you have a foundation.

Don't wait for motivation. Don't wait to "feel ready."

**Pick THREE stupidly small things you can do every day**

So small they feel like a waste of time:
- Put clothes in hamper instead of floor  
- Drink one glass of water
- Walk outside for 10 minutes

That's it.

Do those three things every day for 30 days and prove to yourself you can keep a promise.

Then build from there.

My grandma is 96 and still sharp as hell. She lived through a war, raised 4 kids, and never had the luxury of "waiting to feel motivated."

She just did what needed doing, with or without the good feelings.

If she can do that during actual wartime, I can do my homework while feeling stressed.

You can too.

**TL;DR:** Grandma's WW2 wisdom: separate actions from feelings. Discipline isn't about feeling motivated - it's doing what needs doing anyway. Make starting absurdly small, never miss twice, rig your environment, use timers, track wins. 7 months later: built self-trust by keeping tiny promises, which compounded into actual discipline. First 8 hours after waking = peak willpower window, use it. Discipline = closing gap between what you said and what you did.
