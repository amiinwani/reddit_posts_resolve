# stopped trying to "fix myself" all at once and everything changed - my no BS guide to actually getting unstuck (26M)

gonna be real with you - I've tried to "get my shit together" probably 15 times in the past 5 years

Every time it went the same way:

1. Have breakdown about wasting my life
2. Watch motivational videos until 3am  
3. Create perfect plan: wake up at 5am, cold showers, gym, meditation, journaling, meal prep, side hustle, read for 2 hours
4. Execute perfectly for 3 days  
5. Miss one thing
6. Feel like a failure
7. Abandon everything and go back to scrolling/gaming/eating garbage
8. Repeat in 2-3 months

Sound familiar?

The problem wasn't that I didn't know WHAT to do. Every productivity video says the same shit - exercise, eat healthy, sleep well, work hard, stay focused.

**The problem was I kept trying to become a completely different person overnight.**

And that's just not how humans work.

## the moment everything clicked

I was at my lowest point (again). Living with my parents at 25, barely passing my classes, working a job I hated, no real friends, never had a girlfriend, just... completely stuck.

I looked at myself in the mirror one day and thought **"is this your life? this isn't the life I want to tell my grandkids about someday"**

But instead of making ANOTHER massive "life overhaul" plan, I asked myself: 

**"What is ONE thing I could change right now that would make the biggest difference?"**

Not ten things. Not a complete transformation. ONE thing.

For me, it was my phone usage.

I checked my screen time: 8 hours and 23 minutes. Every. Single. Day.

That's a full-time job worth of scrolling. No wonder I felt like I had no time for anything.

So I decided: **I'm ONLY going to fix that one thing. Everything else can stay broken for now.**

## the ONE CHANGE method (that actually stuck this time)

Here's what I did, and why it worked when nothing else had:

**Week 1-2: Just the phone**

Bought a lockbox (the kind without an emergency open - gotta commit)

Every morning: phone goes in the box from 8am to noon. That's it.

Didn't try to also start working out. Didn't try to fix my diet. Didn't try to meditate.

Just. The. Phone.

Those 4 hours were ROUGH at first. I felt anxious, kept pacing, didn't know what to do with myself.

But you know what happened? **I got bored.**

And when you're bored and can't immediately escape into scrolling, your brain goes "well I guess we actually have to do something now"

**Week 3-4: The cascade started**

Without my phone in the mornings, I started:
- Actually eating breakfast instead of scrolling  
- Going for walks because I had nothing else to do
- Reading (finished my first book in 2 years)
- Getting to work on time (wasn't scrolling in bed for an hour)

I DIDN'T PLAN ANY OF THIS. It just happened naturally because I'd removed the thing that was blocking everything else.

**That's the keystone habit effect.** 

One change unlocks room for other changes without you even trying.

**Month 2-3: Adding more (because I WANTED to, not because I "should")**

Now here's where it's different from my previous attempts:

I didn't force myself to add new habits because "that's what productive people do"

I added them because **I had energy and time now, and actually wanted to**

Started working out 3x/week (not 7x like my previous "perfect plans")
Started cooking actual meals a few times a week (not meal prepping every Sunday)  
Started journaling when I felt like it (not forcing it daily)

50% effort beats 0% effort. Every time.

And you know what? 50% effort sustained over months completely changed my life. 100% effort that I quit after 3 days did nothing.

## the principles that actually work (battle-tested, not from some 22-year-old influencer)

**1. Identify your ONE keystone problem**

For most people it's phone addiction. For some it's sleep schedule. For some it's a specific toxic relationship or bad habit.

What's the ONE thing that, if you fixed it, would make everything else easier?

Start there. ONLY there.

**2. Make the requirement so small you'd feel stupid failing**

Don't try to go from 8 hours of phone time to zero.

Try: phone in a box for 2 hours in the morning. That's it.

Don't try to go from never working out to 6 days a week.

Try: put on gym shoes and go outside for 5 minutes. Just that.

**The requirement should be: "I could do this on my absolute worst day"**

Because you will have worst days. And if your requirement is "work out for 90 minutes" you'll skip it. But "put on shoes and walk outside"? You can do that even when you feel like death.

And once you're outside with shoes on, you usually do more anyway.

**3. Never miss twice (the most important rule)**

You WILL have bad days. Days where you break the streak.

That's fine. That's not failure.

**Failure is missing twice in a row.**

One bad day is life. Two bad days is a pattern. 

Miss your morning phone-free time Monday? Lock that thing up Tuesday NO MATTER WHAT.

50% consistency over months beats 100% consistency for 3 days.

**4. Environmental design > willpower**

I spent YEARS trying to "have more discipline" and just resist my phone

Spoiler: didn't work

What worked: **making it physically impossible to access**

- Lockbox in the morning
- Phone charges in different room at night  
- Deleted apps (not accounts - can access on computer only, adds friction)
- Two browsers: one for work, one for entertainment (my brain knows the difference)

Stop trying to be superhuman. Just rig the environment.

**5. Track your wins to make them feel real**

The difference this time was I actually TRACKED my progress

Every day I put my phone in the lockbox, I marked it down

Seeing "23 day streak" made me not want to break it

Our monkey brains need visual feedback. "I'm doing better" is abstract. "47 unbroken days" is concrete.

I started using [this app](https://getresolveapp.com/app) that shows a visual grid of your habits - seeing the filled-in squares legitimately makes you not want to break the streak. It's dumb how well it works.

## the truth about discipline nobody wants to hear

Discipline isn't some personality trait you either have or don't have.

**Discipline is just self-trust.**

Every time you say "I'll do this" and then do it → +1 self-trust
Every time you say "I'll do this" and don't → -1 self-trust

Do that enough times and you either believe yourself or you don't.

**When I was at my lowest, I didn't believe a single thing I said to myself** because I'd broken so many promises to myself.

"I'll start tomorrow" (didn't start)
"This time will be different" (wasn't different)  
"I'm really gonna change" (didn't change)

My word meant NOTHING, even to me.

Building discipline meant making promises so small I literally couldn't break them, then KEEPING those promises, and slowly rebuilding trust with myself.

Now when I say "I'm gonna do this" - I actually believe me. Because I have months of evidence that I keep my word.

That self-trust is worth more than any productivity hack.

## what happens when you separate actions from feelings

This was the game-changer from my grandma (she's 94):

"During the war I didn't FEEL LIKE rationing food. But I did it anyway. I did it WITH my feelings, not without them."

Most people think: "I'm anxious, so I CAN'T study"  

Reality: "I'm anxious, so I'll study while anxious. What does studying while anxious look like?"

You don't wait to feel good to do what needs doing.

You just do it.

Unmotivated? Work out unmotivated.
Stressed? Write while stressed.
Tired? Start anyway and see what happens.

The feelings come AFTER the action, not before.

## where I'm at now (11 months later)

- Moved out of my parents' place
- Got a better job (not dream job but way better)  
- Working out 3-4x per week consistently  
- Reading 2-3 books a month
- Started a small side project (not making bank but it EXISTS)
- Made some actual friends through gym and a hobby
- Went on a few dates (didn't work out but at least I'm trying)  
- Screen time: 1-2 hours a day instead of 8+

I'm not "fixed" or "perfect" or living some Instagram-worthy life

**But I actually like my life now**  

And the difference between 11 months ago and now isn't that I became a different person.

It's that I made ONE small change that cascaded into more changes, and I built enough self-trust that when I say I'll do something, I actually believe it.

## if you're stuck right now

Stop trying to fix everything at once. You can't.

**Pick ONE thing. The smallest version of improvement you can imagine.**

Not "lose 50 pounds" → "walk for 10 minutes"
Not "quit social media forever" → "phone away for 2 hours in the morning"
Not "start a business" → "spend 20 minutes researching one idea"

Do that one stupidly small thing for 30 days.

Prove to yourself you can keep ONE promise.

Then build from there.

Rome wasn't built in a day, but it WAS built.

Your life won't transform overnight. But it WILL transform if you stop trying to overhaul everything and start with the one thing that would make the biggest difference.

The version of you with their shit together isn't a completely different person.

**It's you, making slightly better choices, slightly more often, over a longer period of time.**

That's it. That's the whole secret.

**TL;DR:** Tried to "fix my life" 15 times, failed every time because I tried to change everything at once. Finally worked when I identified ONE keystone problem (phone addiction), made the requirement stupidly small (lockbox 4 hours/day), tracked wins visually, and never missed twice. One change cascaded into better sleep, workouts, reading, job, social life over 11 months. Discipline = self-trust built by keeping tiny promises. Focus on ONE thing, make it absurdly easy, stack wins over months. Process over perfection.
