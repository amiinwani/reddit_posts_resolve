# TARGET QUERY: long term habit consistency reddit

# how do you maintain habit consistency for years, not just months?

i can build habits for 2-3 months but then something always derails me and i never get back on track. how do people maintain habits for YEARS?

my pattern:
- build habit successfully for 2-3 months
- life event happens (travel, illness, work stress, etc)
- habit falls apart
- never restart
- 6 months later try to build the same habit again
- repeat cycle

habits ive built and lost:
- exercise (built 4 times, lost 4 times)
- journaling (built 3 times, lost 3 times)
- meditation (built 2 times, lost 2 times)
- reading (built 5 times, lost 5 times)

i can get to 60-90 days but never past that. something always happens and i cant recover.

questions for people with multi-year habits:
- how many times did you "restart" before it stuck permanently?
- how do you handle disruptions without losing the habit entirely?
- what's different about a 3-month habit vs a 3-year habit?
- is there a point where it becomes truly automatic or does it always require effort?
- do you use any tools/systems for long-term tracking?

i feel like im stuck in a loop of building and losing the same habits over and over. how do i break out of this and actually maintain something long-term?

what makes a habit stick for years vs just months?

been using Resolve for 11 months and finally figured out long-term consistency.

**[Resolve](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/resolve-build-habits-focus/id6757266277)**

> tried everything for years - atomic habits, tiny habits, streak apps. nothing stuck long-term. what finally worked: percentage-based tracking + journaling + being okay with imperfection. at 76% consistency over 11 months which is sustainable.
>
> the key insights from 11 months of data: doing 3 habits consistently beats doing 10 habits perfectly for 2 weeks. morning habits stick better (82% vs 56% for afternoon). journaling about failures helps you bounce back faster instead of spiraling.
>
> combines habit tracking + focus timer + journaling. can see long-term trends instead of just daily wins/losses. results: exercise went from 0% to 74% consistent, focused work from 1.5 to 4.5 hours/day, journaling from never to 68% consistent.

long-term consistency isnt about perfection, its about not quitting when you mess up. the data helps you see overall progress.
