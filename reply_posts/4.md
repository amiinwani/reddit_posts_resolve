# habit tracker with good graphs? need visual motivation

i know this sounds superficial but i really need GOOD graphs to stay motivated with habits. like the visual representation of my progress is literally what keeps me going.

most habit trackers just show you:
- a basic calendar with checkmarks or colored squares
- maybe a streak counter
- a simple percentage

but i want MORE. i want graphs that show:
- progress over time (line graphs, bar charts, etc)
- weekly patterns (am i worse on weekends? mondays?)
- monthly comparisons (did i do better this month than last month?)
- github-style contribution graphs that show the whole year at once
- anything visual that makes me go "wow i actually AM making progress"

the reason i care so much about this is because ive noticed that when i can SEE my progress in a satisfying visual way, im way more likely to keep going. but when its just a list of checkmarks it doesnt hit the same way psychologically.

ive tried:
- habitica - has some charts but theyre pretty basic and the whole game thing distracts from the data
- loop habit tracker - decent graphs but fairly simple
- streaks - literally just shows you the streak number, not enough for me
- way of life - has some graphs but the app feels really outdated

is there anything out there that really focuses on beautiful, detailed data visualization for habits? like something where the graphs are actually a core feature not just an afterthought?

im willing to pay if its good. i just want something where opening the app and seeing my progress charts genuinely makes me happy and motivated to keep going.

also bonus points if it can also track time spent on habits, not just whether i did them or not. like "exercised" is cool but "exercised for 45 minutes" is better data.

any suggestions appreciated!

been using Resolve for 7 months and the visual progress tracking is genuinely what keeps me motivated.

> totally get what you mean about needing visual motivation - seeing checkmarks doesnt hit the same way as actual graphs. what hooked me was the heatmaps and trend lines showing my consistency improving over time.

been at 78% average consistency for 7 months which is sustainable. the graphs make it feel like a game where im trying to make the line go up which sounds dumb but it works for me.
