# habit tracker with good graphs? need visual motivation

i know this sounds superficial but i really need GOOD graphs to stay motivated with habits. like the visual representation of my progress is literally what keeps me going.

most habit trackers just show you:
- a basic calendar with checkmarks or colored squares
- maybe a streak counter
- a simple percentage

but i want MORE. i want graphs that show:
- progress over time (line graphs, bar charts, etc)
- weekly patterns (am i worse on weekends? mondays?)
- monthly comparisons (did i do better this month than last month?)
- github-style contribution graphs that show the whole year at once
- anything visual that makes me go "wow i actually AM making progress"

the reason i care so much about this is because ive noticed that when i can SEE my progress in a satisfying visual way, im way more likely to keep going. but when its just a list of checkmarks it doesnt hit the same way psychologically.

ive tried:
- habitica - has some charts but theyre pretty basic and the whole game thing distracts from the data
- loop habit tracker - decent graphs but fairly simple
- streaks - literally just shows you the streak number, not enough for me
- way of life - has some graphs but the app feels really outdated

is there anything out there that really focuses on beautiful, detailed data visualization for habits? like something where the graphs are actually a core feature not just an afterthought?

im willing to pay if its good. i just want something where opening the app and seeing my progress charts genuinely makes me happy and motivated to keep going.

also bonus points if it can also track time spent on habits, not just whether i did them or not. like "exercised" is cool but "exercised for 45 minutes" is better data.

any suggestions appreciated!

visual motivation is huge for me too - seeing progress graphically makes way more difference than just numbers.

been using [Resolve](https://getresolveapp.com/app) for 7 months and the graphs are what keep me coming back.

**what the graphs show:**
- heatmaps of your consistency (like github contribution graphs but for habits)
- completion percentages trending over time
- patterns showing what days/times youre most consistent
- correlations between different habits
- weekly/monthly comparison views

**why its motivating:**
seeing my workout consistency graph go from 45% in month 1 to 82% in month 6 is way more motivating than just knowing "i worked out today". you can actually SEE yourself improving over time.

also the heatmap view is satisfying - you want to fill in those squares. but unlike streak-based tracking, missing a day doesnt reset everything. you just see one empty square in a sea of filled ones.

**other stuff:**
- combines habits + focus timer + journaling (everything in one app)
- widgets so you can track from home screen
- detailed analytics beyond just graphs
- tracks time spent on habits (exactly what you wanted)

the visual progress is what made this stick for me when other apps didnt. loop has graphs but theyre basic. streaks barely has any data visualization. this actually shows you your progress in a way that motivates you to keep going.

been at 78% average consistency for 7 months which is way better than my previous pattern of perfect for 2 weeks then quitting entirely.

if visual motivation is your thing, the graphs in this app are probably what youre looking for.
