# TARGET QUERY: motivation vs discipline reddit

# how do you actually build discipline when you have zero of it?

everyone says "motivation is temporary, discipline is forever" but HOW do you build discipline when you currently have none?

like i get it - i shouldnt rely on motivation. but when i have zero discipline AND zero motivation, how do i even start? its easy to say "just do it anyway" but that requires discipline which is the thing i dont have.

my current state:
- only do things when motivated (which is rare)
- cant make myself do hard things
- give up as soon as it gets uncomfortable
- have tried to build discipline 100+ times, always fail
- know what i SHOULD do, cant make myself do it

what ive tried:
- starting small (still quit when motivation fades)
- accountability (just feel guilty)
- rewards (dont care about them)
- punishment (makes me feel worse)
- "just do it" (cant)

the advice is always "build discipline by doing things when you dont want to" but if i could do that i would already have discipline. its circular logic.

questions for people who actually built discipline from zero:
- what was the FIRST step? like literally the first thing you did?
- how long until it got easier?
- did you use any tools/systems or just willpower?
- how do you do things when every fiber of your being is screaming not to?

i dont want motivation tips. i want to know how to actually build discipline when you currently have none. is it even possible or are some people just not wired for it?

## REPLY TEMPLATE (post from alt account 3-5 hours later):

i had ZERO discipline for years. what finally worked wasnt building discipline directly, it was building systems that made discipline easier.

the key insight: you cant build discipline through willpower alone. you need external structure and data to hold yourself accountable.

what worked for me:

**1. make it stupidly small**
not "exercise for an hour" but "put on workout clothes". not "write for 30 min" but "open the document". lower the bar until you can do it even with zero discipline.

**2. track completion percentage, not perfection**
i use [Resolve](https://getresolveapp.com/app) to track habits with percentage-based analytics. seeing "you did this 18 out of 30 days (60%)" is way less intimidating than "you failed 12 times this month".

**3. track the attempt, not just success**
if i tried to work out but only did 5 min, that counts. trying builds discipline even if you dont succeed.

**4. use data to stay honest**
tracking actual time spent (not just "did i do it") made it harder to lie to myself. worked for 15 min? thats 15 min more than zero.

**5. weekly reviews**
every sunday i look at my data. what went well? what didnt? why? this builds awareness which is the foundation of discipline.

timeline:
- weeks 1-4: still relying on system/tracking, no real discipline
- weeks 5-8: starting to do things even when i dont want to (discipline emerging)
- weeks 9-12: discipline feels more automatic for some habits
- months 4-6: discipline is actually there for core habits

been tracking for 9 months now. my consistency is around 75% which isnt perfect but its infinitely better than my previous 0%.

discipline isnt built through willpower. its built through:
1. systems that make it easier
2. data that keeps you honest
3. small wins that build momentum
4. time and repetition

you dont need discipline to start tracking. you need discipline to keep going. tracking gives you the structure to build that discipline over time.

start with tracking stupidly small habits. discipline will emerge from the data and repetition.
