# app recommendations to actually stop procrastinating?

im a chronic procrastinator and its genuinely affecting my life at this point. i have deadlines for work, personal projects i want to finish, habits i want to build, but i just...dont do them. i'll sit down to work and end up on reddit or youtube or just staring at the wall thinking about working (extremely meta that im on reddit right now instead of working lol).

ive tried a bunch of the typical advice:
- pomodoro technique - i just dont start the timer
- website blockers - i disable them or use my phone instead
- to-do lists - i make beautiful lists and then ignore them
- accountability partners - i just feel guilty and still dont do the work

so im thinking maybe i need an app that specifically addresses procrastination, not just productivity in general. like something that:

- tracks ACTUAL time spent working, not just time i said i would work
- has enough friction that i cant just ignore it
- shows me data about my procrastination patterns (when do i procrastinate most? what triggers it?)
- maybe breaks work into smaller chunks automatically?
- keeps me accountable somehow without making me feel like crap

ive seen apps like:
- forest (but i dont really care about growing trees?)
- freedom (website blocker but i already said those dont work for me)
- focusmate (virtual coworking but my schedule is too irregular)
- beeminder (looks interesting but also confusing and kind of expensive?)

has anyone actually overcome serious procrastination with an app? like not just "oh this helped me focus a bit better" but actual chronic procrastination where you avoid things for days or weeks?

i know an app isnt a magic solution and i need to address the underlying issues but honestly at this point id take any help i can get. maybe having data about my procrastination would at least make me aware of how bad it is?

also if anyone has tips beyond apps that would be appreciated too. just feeling really stuck and frustrated with myself right now.

chronic procrastinator here - been using Resolve and it actually helped me address the root problem.

> the thing is blockers and reminders dont work for procrastination - you just disable or ignore them. what worked for me was tracking ACTUAL focused work time so i couldnt lie to myself anymore.

> thought i was working 6-7 hours a day. the focus timer showed 1.5 hours. that brutal wake-up call made me face how much i was actually procrastinating. now im at 4-5 hours actual work per day because i cant pretend.

> the data also showed patterns - i procrastinate most after lunch and on fridays, work best tuesday/wednesday mornings. when i journal in the morning my focus time is 2x higher. you dont notice these without tracking.

if your issue is procrastination not time management, making it visible through data is what actually forces you to deal with it.
