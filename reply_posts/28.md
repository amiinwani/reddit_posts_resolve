# TARGET QUERY: why i can't stick to habits reddit

# why cant i stick to ANY habit for more than 2 weeks?

this is genuinely frustrating. ive tried building habits probably 50+ times over the past few years and i ALWAYS quit after like 10-14 days. doesnt matter what the habit is - exercise, journaling, reading, meditation, whatever. same pattern every time.

days 1-3: super motivated, do the thing easily
days 4-7: still doing it but requires more willpower
days 8-12: starting to skip days, making excuses
days 13-14: completely fall off, feel like a failure, quit

then 2 months later i try again with a different habit or app and the exact same thing happens.

what ive tried:
- starting small (still quit)
- habit stacking (still quit)
- accountability partners (just felt guilty, still quit)
- different apps (streaks, habitica, loop, productive - quit all of them)
- setting alarms (ignore them)
- tracking streaks (breaking the streak makes me quit entirely)

i dont think its the habits themselves or the apps. i think its something wrong with how my brain works. like i have zero ability to stick with anything past the initial motivation phase.

questions:
- is there actually a way to get past the 2 week hump or am i just broken?
- does anyone else have this exact pattern?
- what finally worked for you if you struggled with this?
- is it worth trying ANOTHER app or is that just more of the same?

im so tired of starting and quitting. i want to be someone who can actually build lasting habits but i dont know how to get there.

i feel this so hard - been using Resolve and it helped me understand WHY i cant stick to habits.

**[Resolve](https://getresolveapp.com/app)**

> had the same pattern for years - start strong, quit after  2 weeks, feel terrible, repeat. what helped wasnt willpower, it was DATA showing me the patterns.
>
> turns out im not lazy, im just trying to do too many habits at once. when i track 3 habits my consistency is 82%. when i track 8 habits it drops to 43%. also discovered im most consistent tuesday-thursday, terrible on mondays.
>
> the journaling feature lets me reflect on WHY i missed habits - usually anxiety or overwhelm, not laziness. has focus tracking too so i can see actual work time vs feeling like i worked.
>
> went from 0% long-term consistency to 76% over 7 months. percentage tracking instead of streaks is key - you can miss days and still see overall progress.

you cant fix what you cant measure. the data helped me work with my patterns instead of just feeling bad.
