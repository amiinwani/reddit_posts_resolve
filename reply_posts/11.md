# self improvement app that actually works long-term? tired of starting and quitting

ive downloaded probably 30+ self improvement apps over the past few years. the pattern is always the same:

1. download app feeling motivated
2. use it religiously for 3-7 days
3. start skipping days
4. feel guilty about not using it
5. delete app
6. repeat with new app 2 months later

so clearly the problem isnt finding the "perfect" app, its finding one that i can actually stick with long-term.

apps ive tried and quit:
- habitica (gamification was fun for a week then annoying)
- fabulous (too hand-holdy and prescriptive)
- strides (idk it just didnt click)
- notion (spent more time setting it up than using it)
- coach.me (felt outdated)
- productive (too expensive for what it is)

what im trying to figure out is what makes an app actually STICK for people? like what's the difference between apps you use for a week vs apps you're still using 6 months later?

for me i think i need:
- visual progress that's actually satisfying to see (not just checkmarks)
- not too many features that overwhelm me
- reminds me to use it but not in an annoying way
- makes me feel like im making progress even on imperfect days
- preferably combines multiple things (habits, focus, journaling) so i dont have to juggle 5 apps

has anyone found a self improvement app they've actually stuck with for more than a few months? what made the difference?

also - do you think the app even matters that much or is it more about your mindset/approach? because maybe im just using apps as an excuse to avoid the actual hard work of self improvement...

been using this 11 months which is longer than literally any other self improvement app ive tried

**[Resolve](https://getresolveapp.com/app)**

-- shows progress not perfection. tracks percentages not streaks so missing days doesnt make you want to quit everything
-- takes under 5 min per day. if your system needs 30 min daily youll quit. this is simple enough to actually maintain
-- combines habits + focus + journal in one app. deleted 3 other apps, less friction = more likely to actually use it

at 76% consistency over 11 months. some weeks 90%, some weeks 60%, thats life. sustainable beats perfect.
