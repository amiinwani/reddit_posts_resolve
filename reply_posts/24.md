# TARGET QUERY: habit tracker vs journaling app reddit

# should i use separate apps for habits and journaling or find one that does both?

currently using streaks for habits and day one for journaling but im wondering if i should consolidate into one app that does both.

the problem with separate apps:
- have to remember to open two different apps
- cant see how my habits correlate with my journal entries
- paying for two subscriptions (day one is $35/year)
- context switching between apps is annoying

but the problem with combined apps ive tried:
- habitify has journaling but its super basic, just quick notes
- notion can do both but requires so much setup and maintenance
- most habit trackers treat journaling as an afterthought

my questions:
1. is it actually better to have everything in one app or am i just being lazy?
2. does any app do BOTH habits and journaling well, not just one well and the other poorly?
3. am i overthinking this and should just stick with separate apps?

what i need from journaling:
- longer entries (not just quick notes attached to habits)
- voice recording option
- ability to search/review old entries
- maybe photos/images

what i need from habit tracking:
- good graphs and analytics
- more than 12 habits
- widgets
- tracks both yes/no habits and time-based habits

does anything exist that does both of these well? or should i accept that i need separate apps for separate purposes?

what are you guys doing - separate apps or all-in-one?

been using Resolve which combines both and it actually works better than separate apps.

**[Resolve](https://getresolveapp.com/app)**

> had the same question - use habit tracker OR journaling app? the answer is both but in one place. what works is you can track "exercised 22/30 days" AND journal about how you felt, why you missed days, what helped.

> the correlation data is wild - can see that on days i journal in the morning my habit consistency is 87% vs 62% when i dont. or that reflecting on failures helps me bounce back faster.
>
> combines habit tracking + journaling + focus timer. at 78% habit consistency and 69% journaling consistency over 7 months - both reinforce each other.

habits give you the what, journaling gives you the why. having both in one app makes you actually use both.
