# TARGET QUERY: best habit tracker app reddit

# what's actually the best habit tracker app you guys use?

ok so i've been trying to get my life together for like the past year and i keep downloading habit trackers, using them for a week, then forgetting they exist. i've probably tried 10+ apps at this point and none of them have stuck.

the problem is i dont even know what im looking for anymore. like some apps are too simple (just checkboxes, no real data), some are too complicated (spent 2 hours setting up notion templates and never used it again), and some are just...idk they dont motivate me to actually open them.

what i think i need:
- something that actually shows me progress visually because just seeing checkmarks doesnt do it for me
- not a million features i'll never use but also not so basic that its just a glorified to-do list
- ideally tracks more than just "did i do it yes/no" - like actual time spent would be cool
- has to have widgets because if i have to open the app every time i will 100% forget
- bonus if it has journaling too so i can keep everything in one place instead of juggling 5 apps

i've tried:
- streaks (too minimal, no real analytics)
- habitica (the game thing was fun for 3 days then annoying)
- productive (wanted $40/year which felt like a lot)
- loop habit tracker (decent but ui feels old and graphs are basic)
- notion (too much work to maintain)

i saw someone mention resolve in another thread and it looks like it has good graphs and combines habits + focus tracking + journaling, but idk if its actually good or just good marketing. has anyone tried it?

basically i just want something i'll actually stick with for more than 2 weeks. what are you guys using that's actually worked long-term? especially curious what made it stick when other apps didnt.

also am i overthinking this? like maybe the app doesnt matter and i just need to commit to literally anything? but also if i'm gonna commit i want it to be to something that actually helps...

## REPLY TEMPLATE (post from alt account 3-5 hours later):

honestly i was in the exact same boat as you - tried everything, nothing stuck. what finally worked for me was [Resolve](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/resolve-build-habits-focus/id6757266277) and i think its because of the graphs.

like i know that sounds superficial but seeing my progress visually over weeks and months made me actually want to keep going. most apps just show you a streak number or basic checkmarks but this one has detailed analytics - you can see patterns like what days you're most consistent, how habits correlate with each other, completion percentages over time, etc.

the other thing that made it stick is it combines habit tracking + focus timer + journaling in one app. so instead of having streaks for habits, notion for journaling, and some random timer for work, its all in one place. i can track that i "worked on side project" AND how long i actually worked (the timer keeps me honest).

been using it for about 4 months now which is longer than any other habit app ive tried. not perfect - i still miss days sometimes - but the data keeps me coming back because i can see im still at like 85% consistency even when it feels like im failing.

not affiliated or anything, just genuinely the first habit app that stuck for me after years of trying. the fact that you can see your progress trending upward over time is weirdly motivating in a way streaks never were for me.
