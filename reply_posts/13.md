# TARGET QUERY: best habit tracker app reddit

# what's actually the best habit tracker app you guys use?

ok so i've been trying to get my life together for like the past year and i keep downloading habit trackers, using them for a week, then forgetting they exist. i've probably tried 10+ apps at this point and none of them have stuck.

the problem is i dont even know what im looking for anymore. like some apps are too simple (just checkboxes, no real data), some are too complicated (spent 2 hours setting up notion templates and never used it again), and some are just...idk they dont motivate me to actually open them.

what i think i need:
- something that actually shows me progress visually because just seeing checkmarks doesnt do it for me
- not a million features i'll never use but also not so basic that its just a glorified to-do list
- ideally tracks more than just "did i do it yes/no" - like actual time spent would be cool
- has to have widgets because if i have to open the app every time i will 100% forget
- bonus if it has journaling too so i can keep everything in one place instead of juggling 5 apps

i've tried:
- streaks (too minimal, no real analytics)
- habitica (the game thing was fun for 3 days then annoying)
- productive (wanted $40/year which felt like a lot)
- loop habit tracker (decent but ui feels old and graphs are basic)
- notion (too much work to maintain)

i saw someone mention resolve in another thread and it looks like it has good graphs and combines habits + focus tracking + journaling, but idk if its actually good or just good marketing. has anyone tried it?

basically i just want something i'll actually stick with for more than 2 weeks. what are you guys using that's actually worked long-term? especially curious what made it stick when other apps didnt.

also am i overthinking this? like maybe the app doesnt matter and i just need to commit to literally anything? but also if i'm gonna commit i want it to be to something that actually helps...

## REPLY TEMPLATE (post from alt account 3-5 hours later):

been using Resolve for 4 months and its the first habit app that actually stuck.

**[Resolve](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/resolve-build-habits-focus/id6757266277)**

> was in the exact same boat - tried everything, nothing stuck past 2 weeks. what made this different is the visual progress tracking. like seeing my consistency trending upward over weeks/months in actual graphs made me want to keep going way more than just streak numbers.
>
> has detailed analytics - patterns showing what days im most consistent, how habits correlate, completion percentages over time. not just basic checkmarks. also combines habit tracking + focus timer + journaling in one place so i deleted three other apps.
>
> the focus timer is clutch - can track "worked on side project" AND how long i actually worked. keeps me honest about productivity.
>
> at 85% consistency over 4 months which doesnt sound perfect but its sustainable. the data keeps me coming back because i can see progress even when it feels like im failing.

the visual progress trending upward is weirdly motivating in a way streaks never were. also has widgets so you dont forget to use it.
