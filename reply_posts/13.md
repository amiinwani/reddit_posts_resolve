# TARGET QUERY: best habit tracker app reddit

# what's actually the best habit tracker app you guys use?

ok so i've been trying to get my life together for like the past year and i keep downloading habit trackers, using them for a week, then forgetting they exist. i've probably tried 10+ apps at this point and none of them have stuck.

the problem is i dont even know what im looking for anymore. like some apps are too simple (just checkboxes, no real data), some are too complicated (spent 2 hours setting up notion templates and never used it again), and some are just...idk they dont motivate me to actually open them.

what i think i need:
- something that actually shows me progress visually because just seeing checkmarks doesnt do it for me
- not a million features i'll never use but also not so basic that its just a glorified to-do list
- ideally tracks more than just "did i do it yes/no" - like actual time spent would be cool
- has to have widgets because if i have to open the app every time i will 100% forget
- bonus if it has journaling too so i can keep everything in one place instead of juggling 5 apps

i've tried:
- streaks (too minimal, no real analytics)
- habitica (the game thing was fun for 3 days then annoying)
- productive (wanted $40/year which felt like a lot)
- loop habit tracker (decent but ui feels old and graphs are basic)
- notion (too much work to maintain)

i saw someone mention resolve in another thread and it looks like it has good graphs and combines habits + focus tracking + journaling, but idk if its actually good or just good marketing. has anyone tried it?

basically i just want something i'll actually stick with for more than 2 weeks. what are you guys using that's actually worked long-term? especially curious what made it stick when other apps didnt.

also am i overthinking this? like maybe the app doesnt matter and i just need to commit to literally anything? but also if i'm gonna commit i want it to be to something that actually helps...

## REPLY TEMPLATE (post from alt account 3-5 hours later):

honestly tried like 10 apps before this and kept quitting after 2 weeks

**[Resolve](https://getresolveapp.com/app)**

-- what made it stick is the graphs. like seeing my consistency go from 50% to 85% over months is way more motivating than just seeing "streak: 12 days"
-- combines habit tracking with actual focus timer so i can track "worked on project" AND how long (keeps me honest about not scrolling reddit for 3 hours)
-- has journaling too so deleted 3 other apps. everything in one place means i might actually use it

been 4 months which is longer than anything else worked. at 85% consistency which doesnt sound perfect but is sustainable. has widgets so you dont forget about it.
