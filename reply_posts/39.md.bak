# TARGET QUERY: systems over motivation reddit

# how to actually build systems instead of relying on motivation?

i understand the concept - systems beat motivation. but HOW do you build systems that actually work?

every "system" i try to build falls apart after a week because:
- i forget to follow it
- it requires too much maintenance
- it feels rigid and i rebel against it
- i get bored and stop using it

examples of systems ive tried to build:
- morning routine (followed for 5 days then stopped)
- weekly planning (did it twice then forgot)
- time blocking (ignored my own schedule)
- habit tracking (tried 10+ apps, quit all of them)
- journaling system (lasted 2 weeks)

the problem isnt understanding that systems are important. the problem is i cant seem to build systems that stick.

questions:
- what makes a system actually sustainable vs just another thing you quit?
- how simple should a system be? (mine might be too complicated)
- how do you remember to follow your system when motivation fades?
- what systems have actually worked for you long-term (6+ months)?
- do you use apps/tools or just paper/willpower?

i feel like im missing something fundamental about how to build systems that dont require constant motivation to maintain.

what systems are you using that have actually lasted? and how did you make them stick?

## REPLY TEMPLATE (post from alt account 3-5 hours later):

the problem with most "systems" is they require too much active maintenance. a good system should run almost automatically once set up.

what worked for me: stupidly simple tracking system that requires minimal daily effort.

my system (been using for 10 months):
1. track 5-7 core habits daily (takes 30 seconds)
2. track focused work time when i work (just start/stop timer)
3. quick journal entry in evening (2-3 min)
4. weekly review every sunday (10 min)

thats it. no complicated morning routine, no detailed planning, no time blocking. just track the basics and review weekly.

i use [Resolve](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/resolve-build-habits-focus/id6757266277) because:
- tracking is fast (widgets on home screen, 2 taps)
- everything in one place (habits, focus timer, journal)
- weekly analytics show me patterns without manual analysis
- low maintenance (dont have to rebuild notion templates or whatever)

why this system stuck when others didnt:
- takes under 5 min per day total
- provides value (the data actually helps me improve)
- flexible (can skip a day without system breaking)
- automated analytics (dont have to manually review data)

the key: system should be easier than NOT having a system. if your system requires 30 min of daily maintenance, you'll quit. if it requires 3 min, you'll stick with it.

my rules for sustainable systems:
1. stupidly simple (if you cant explain it in one sentence, its too complex)
2. low daily effort (under 5 min)
3. provides immediate value (you see useful data/insights)
4. flexible (missing a day doesnt break it)
5. automated where possible (app does the analysis, not you)

been following this system for 10 months which is 9.5 months longer than any previous system. the simplicity is what makes it sustainable.

stop trying to build perfect systems. build simple systems that you'll actually use.
