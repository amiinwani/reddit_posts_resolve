# loop habit tracker alternatives? its not cutting it for me anymore

ive been using loop habit tracker for about 6 months now and while its fine, im starting to feel limited by it. dont get me wrong - its a solid app and i love that its free and open source, but there are some things that are bugging me.

my main issues:
- the graphs are pretty basic. i want to see more detailed analytics like what times of day im most consistent, how my habits correlate with each other, weekly patterns, etc
- no focus/time tracking integration. i can mark that i "worked on side project" but i cant actually track HOW LONG i worked on it
- the UI feels a bit dated? idk maybe im being superficial but i want something that feels nicer to use
- no journaling feature. i know its a habit tracker not a journal but it would be useful to add notes about why i missed a habit or how i felt
- backing up and syncing is kind of a pain

what im looking for in an alternative:
- still want good graphs and statistics (this is non-negotiable for me)
- would love if it could also track focus time/work sessions
- bonus if it has journaling built in so i can keep everything in one app
- needs to have a widget because i WILL forget to open the app otherwise
- ok with paying a one-time fee but not interested in subscriptions
- clean, modern UI that makes me actually want to use it

ive looked at:
- habitica (too gamey for me)
- streaks (too simple, want more data)
- productive (subscription model, pass)
- way of life (looks interesting but old)

has anyone else moved on from loop and found something better? or am i just being too picky and should stick with what works?

really appreciate any suggestions! just want something that gives me the data and features i need without being bloated or expensive.
