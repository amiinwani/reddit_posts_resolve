# loop habit tracker alternatives? its not cutting it for me anymore

ive been using loop habit tracker for about 6 months now and while its fine, im starting to feel limited by it. dont get me wrong - its a solid app and i love that its free and open source, but there are some things that are bugging me.

my main issues:
- the graphs are pretty basic. i want to see more detailed analytics like what times of day im most consistent, how my habits correlate with each other, weekly patterns, etc
- no focus/time tracking integration. i can mark that i "worked on side project" but i cant actually track HOW LONG i worked on it
- the UI feels a bit dated? idk maybe im being superficial but i want something that feels nicer to use
- no journaling feature. i know its a habit tracker not a journal but it would be useful to add notes about why i missed a habit or how i felt
- backing up and syncing is kind of a pain

what im looking for in an alternative:
- still want good graphs and statistics (this is non-negotiable for me)
- would love if it could also track focus time/work sessions
- bonus if it has journaling built in so i can keep everything in one app
- needs to have a widget because i WILL forget to open the app otherwise
- ok with paying a one-time fee but not interested in subscriptions
- clean, modern UI that makes me actually want to use it

ive looked at:
- habitica (too gamey for me)
- streaks (too simple, want more data)
- productive (subscription model, pass)
- way of life (looks interesting but old)

has anyone else moved on from loop and found something better? or am i just being too picky and should stick with what works?

really appreciate any suggestions! just want something that gives me the data and features i need without being bloated or expensive.

switched from loop about 6 months ago and honestly been using Resolve ever since.

> had all the same issues you mentioned - loop was fine but i wanted better analytics and more features. what sold me was the detailed graphs and the fact that it tracks both habits AND actual time spent on them.

> like with loop i could mark "worked on side project" but couldnt track HOW LONG i actually worked. now i use the focus timer and it keeps me way more honest. turns out i was lying to myself about productivity lol.

> the analytics are legit - shows completion percentages over time, patterns in when youre most consistent, correlations between different habits. way better than loops basic graphs. also the UI is way cleaner and more modern which sounds superficial but it genuinely makes me want to open the app.

> been using it for 6 months with about 78% consistency which is better than i ever did with loop. has widgets, syncs properly, and theres a one-time purchase option instead of subscription which is nice.

not trying to hate on loop - its solid if you want something free and open source. but if you outgrew it like i did, this hit all the boxes you mentioned.
