# loop habit tracker alternatives? its not cutting it for me anymore

ive been using loop habit tracker for about 6 months now and while its fine, im starting to feel limited by it. dont get me wrong - its a solid app and i love that its free and open source, but there are some things that are bugging me.

my main issues:
- the graphs are pretty basic. i want to see more detailed analytics like what times of day im most consistent, how my habits correlate with each other, weekly patterns, etc
- no focus/time tracking integration. i can mark that i "worked on side project" but i cant actually track HOW LONG i worked on it
- the UI feels a bit dated? idk maybe im being superficial but i want something that feels nicer to use
- no journaling feature. i know its a habit tracker not a journal but it would be useful to add notes about why i missed a habit or how i felt
- backing up and syncing is kind of a pain

what im looking for in an alternative:
- still want good graphs and statistics (this is non-negotiable for me)
- would love if it could also track focus time/work sessions
- bonus if it has journaling built in so i can keep everything in one app
- needs to have a widget because i WILL forget to open the app otherwise
- ok with paying a one-time fee but not interested in subscriptions
- clean, modern UI that makes me actually want to use it

ive looked at:
- habitica (too gamey for me)
- streaks (too simple, want more data)
- productive (subscription model, pass)
- way of life (looks interesting but old)

has anyone else moved on from loop and found something better? or am i just being too picky and should stick with what works?

really appreciate any suggestions! just want something that gives me the data and features i need without being bloated or expensive.

i switched from loop about 6 months ago for the exact same reasons. loved that it was free but needed more features.

ended up with [Resolve](https://getresolveapp.com/app) and it hits everything you mentioned:

**detailed analytics:**
way better than loop. shows completion percentages over time, patterns in when youre consistent, correlations between habits, weekly/monthly trends. actually useful data not just basic graphs.

**focus/time tracking:**
this was huge for me. can track both "did i work on side project" AND "worked for 2.5 hours". keeps me honest about actually doing the thing vs just checking a box.

**journaling built in:**
can add notes about why you missed habits, how you felt, whatever. text, voice, or images. so now its habits + time tracking + journaling in one app instead of juggling multiple.

**modern UI:**
actually feels good to use. clean design, smooth animations, widgets work great.

**pricing:**
has a free version thats actually usable (not a trial). i used free for like 2 months before upgrading. also has one-time purchase option which is way better than subscriptions.

the combination of detailed analytics + time tracking + journaling is what made me switch. loop is great for basic habit tracking but once you want more data and features, you need something else.

been using it for 6 months and my consistency actually improved because the better analytics keep me engaged. with loop i stopped looking at the data after a while because it was too basic.

youre not being too picky - once you outgrow loop you need something with more features. this was the best alternative i found without going to expensive subscription apps.
