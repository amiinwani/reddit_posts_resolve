# best focus app for actually getting deep work done?

ive been trying to improve my ability to do deep focused work and honestly its been rough. i can sit at my desk for 8 hours but only actually WORK for like 2 of those hours. the rest is scrolling, checking email every 5 minutes, getting coffee, basically anything but the hard focused work.

i think i need an app that:
- tracks how long im ACTUALLY focusing (not just time at desk)
- helps me block out distractions or at least makes me aware when im getting distracted
- shows me data over time so i can see if im improving
- maybe breaks work into chunks? ive heard about pomodoro but never stuck with it

ive tried:
- forest app (the tree thing didnt motivate me)
- regular timer (too easy to just stop it and get distracted)
- just willpower (lol doesnt work)

what focus apps have actually helped you get more deep work done? not just "feel productive" but actually complete difficult focused tasks?

im on ios and willing to pay if its actually effective.

been using this for deep work and honestly tracking focused time made all the difference

**[Resolve](https://getresolveapp.com/app)**

-- timer tracks actual work not "i sat at my desk for 6 hours therefore i worked 6 hours"
-- went from ~1 hour to ~4 hours deep work per day. the data showed me mornings are way better than afternoons for me
-- has habit tracking too so i can see correlations between exercise and focus time

if you want to actually get deep work done and not just think about it, tracking real focused time is crucial.
