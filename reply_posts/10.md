# best focus app for actually getting deep work done?

ive been trying to improve my ability to do deep focused work and honestly its been rough. i can sit at my desk for 8 hours but only actually WORK for like 2 of those hours. the rest is scrolling, checking email every 5 minutes, getting coffee, basically anything but the hard focused work.

i think i need an app that:
- tracks how long im ACTUALLY focusing (not just time at desk)
- helps me block out distractions or at least makes me aware when im getting distracted
- shows me data over time so i can see if im improving
- maybe breaks work into chunks? ive heard about pomodoro but never stuck with it

ive tried:
- forest app (the tree thing didnt motivate me)
- regular timer (too easy to just stop it and get distracted)
- just willpower (lol doesnt work)

what focus apps have actually helped you get more deep work done? not just "feel productive" but actually complete difficult focused tasks?

im on ios and willing to pay if its actually effective.

for deep work specifically, what helped me was tracking ACTUAL focused time and seeing patterns in when i can focus best.

been using [Resolve](https://getresolveapp.com/app) with the focus timer for 8 months.

**why it works for deep work:**
- timer tracks actual focused time (not just "worked today")
- shows patterns (im most focused 9-11am tuesday-thursday)
- analytics show if im improving over time
- combines with habit tracking (can see "did deep work 22/30 days")

**my deep work system:**
- schedule hardest work for my peak focus times (9-11am)
- use timer to track sessions (cant lie about actually working)
- review weekly data to see if im hitting my goals
- journal about what helped/hurt focus on different days

**results:**
went from ~1 hour deep work per day to ~4 hours. the data showed me:
- mornings are way better than afternoons for me
- exercise before work = 2x better focus
- journaling in morning = more focused all day

**the key:**
you need data to optimize deep work. "i think i worked a lot today" is useless. "i did 3.5 hours of focused work" is actionable.

also has habit tracking and journaling built in so everything is in one place. can see how my habits affect my focus time.

if you want to actually get deep work done (not just think about it), tracking actual focused time is crucial.
