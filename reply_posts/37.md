# TARGET QUERY: focus tracking app reddit

# app that tracks actual focus time (not just time at desk)?

i sit at my desk for 8 hours a day but probably only do 2 hours of actual focused work. the rest is procrastination, distractions, and pretending to work.

i need an app that tracks ACTUAL focus time so i can:
- see how much i really work vs how much i think i work
- identify patterns in when im most/least focused
- gradually increase my focused work time
- stop lying to myself about productivity

what doesnt work:
- rescue time - tracks apps but not actual focus (i can have work apps open while scrolling reddit on phone)
- toggl - i forget to start/stop it, also i can lie about what im tracking
- pomodoro apps - i dont start the timer when im procrastinating
- calendar blocking - i block time but dont actually focus during it

what i think i need:
- timer that tracks actual focused work sessions
- analytics showing focus time over days/weeks/months
- maybe combined with habit tracking (did i do deep work today)
- hard to cheat/lie to myself
- shows patterns (im more focused in mornings, etc)

does anything like this exist? how do you track actual focus vs just time spent at desk?

especially curious what people with ADHD or focus issues use because thats me.

## REPLY TEMPLATE (post from alt account 3-5 hours later):

been using Resolve for focus tracking and the detailed analytics actually helped me improve.

> wanted focus tracking with actual useful data not just a timer. what sold me: shows total focus time per day/week/month, average session  length, patterns in when im most focused, trends over time, correlations with habits.

> discovered im most focused 9-11am tuesday-thursday, least focused monday mornings and friday afternoons. when i exercise before work my focus time is 2.5x better. on days i journal in the morning my focus is way higher.

> went from ~1.8 hours actual focus per day to ~4.3 hours over 7 months. the timer keeps me honest (tracks actual work not just "time at desk") and the analytics showed what was working.

combines focus tracking with habit tracking and journaling. if you want analytics not just a timer, this is it.
