# TARGET QUERY: dopamine detox app reddit

# app for dopamine detox that actually works?

trying to do a dopamine detox but just deleting social media apps doesnt work - i redownload them within a day. i need something with more structure and accountability.

what im trying to detox from:
- social media (instagram, tiktok, twitter)
- youtube rabbit holes
- mindless phone scrolling
- video games
- basically any high-dopamine instant gratification stuff

what ive tried:
- just deleting apps (redownload them same day)
- opal/one sec (i disable them when i really want to check)
- screen time limits (i ignore them)
- going cold turkey (lasted 2 days, felt miserable, gave up)

the problem is willpower alone doesnt work. i need:
- something that tracks my progress so i can see if im actually reducing screen time
- replacement activities tracked in the same place
- data about what triggers my dopamine-seeking behavior
- gradual reduction not cold turkey (that never works for me)

has anyone successfully done a dopamine detox using an app or system? what actually worked?

specifically:
- how did you track both the "bad" habits (screen time) and replacement habits (reading, exercise, etc)?
- how long until you stopped craving the dopamine hits?
- did you go cold turkey or gradual?
- what app/system kept you accountable?

i know i need to reset my dopamine baseline but i dont know how to actually do it in a sustainable way.

been doing dopamine detox tracking and its way better than just willpower

-- detox isnt about blocking everything, its replacing bad with good. tracked BOTH screen time reduction AND replacement activities (reading, exercise, work)
-- over 5 months: screen time 6h to 2h per day, phone pickups 160 to 55 per day, reading 0 to 7 books, focused work 0 to 3.5h per day
-- can see both what im avoiding AND what im doing instead. has journaling to reflect on relapses

detox only works if you replace dopamine hits with something better. tracking both sides keeps you honest.
