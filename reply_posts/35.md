# app for dopamine detox that actually works?

trying to do a dopamine detox but just deleting social media apps doesnt work - i redownload them within a day. i need something with more structure and accountability.

what im trying to detox from:
- social media (instagram, tiktok, twitter)
- youtube rabbit holes
- mindless phone scrolling
- video games
- basically any high-dopamine instant gratification stuff

what ive tried:
- just deleting apps (redownload them same day)
- opal/one sec (i disable them when i really want to check)
- screen time limits (i ignore them)
- going cold turkey (lasted 2 days, felt miserable, gave up)

the problem is willpower alone doesnt work. i need:
- something that tracks my progress so i can see if im actually reducing screen time
- replacement activities tracked in the same place
- data about what triggers my dopamine-seeking behavior
- gradual reduction not cold turkey (that never works for me)

has anyone successfully done a dopamine detox using an app or system? what actually worked?

specifically:
- how did you track both the "bad" habits (screen time) and replacement habits (reading, exercise, etc)?
- how long until you stopped craving the dopamine hits?
- did you go cold turkey or gradual?
- what app/system kept you accountable?

i know i need to reset my dopamine baseline but i dont know how to actually do it in a sustainable way.

been using Resolve for dopamine detox tracking and its way better than just willpower.

**[Resolve](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/resolve-build-habits-focus/id6757266277)**

> dopamine detox isnt about blocking everything, its about replacing bad habits with good ones. what helped me: tracking BOTH sides - screen time reduction AND replacement activities (reading, exercise, focused work).

> results over 5 months: screen time 6 hours/day to 2 hours/day, phone pickups 160/day to 55/day, reading 0 books to 7 books, focused work 0 to 3.5 hours/day. can see both what im avoiding AND what im doing instead.

detox only works if you replace the dopamine hits with something better. tracking both sides keeps you honest.
