# app for digital minimalism that isnt just a website blocker?

trying to embrace digital minimalism but most "digital minimalism apps" are just website/app blockers which i can easily disable when i want to cheat.

what i want is something that helps me:
- track my digital consumption (screen time, app usage, etc)
- build better digital habits (no phone first hour, etc)
- replace digital time with real activities
- see my progress over time
- actually stick with it long-term

ive tried:
- opal - good blocker but i disable it when i really want to check something
- one sec - adds friction but doesnt track progress
- screen time (ios) - tracks but doesnt help me build replacement habits
- freedom - blocks stuff but doesnt address the underlying behavior

the issue is blocking alone doesnt work because i can always unblock. i need something that helps me actually WANT to use my phone less, not just forces me to.

what are digital minimalists actually using? is there an app that combines:
- tracking digital consumption
- building offline habits
- showing progress over time
- maybe journaling about relationship with tech

or do you just use a combination of apps? what's worked for people who successfully reduced their digital dependence?

the problem with blockers is they're all willpower-based. you can always disable them. what worked for me was tracking both sides: less screen time AND more offline activities.

i use [Resolve](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/resolve-build-habits-focus/id6757266277) to track:
- "no phone first hour" habit
- "no social media before noon" habit
- replacement habits (reading, exercise, focused work)
- actual time spent on offline activities (not just "did i do it")

the key is seeing the tradeoff. when i spend 4 hours on my phone, i can see i only did 30 min of reading. when i spend 1 hour on phone, i did 2 hours of reading. makes the cost of phone time visible.

also use opal for blocking but the tracking is more important than the blocking. seeing my screen time trend down over weeks kept me motivated even when i wanted to give up.

my digital minimalism system:
- opal blocks distracting apps during work hours
- resolve tracks both digital habits (less phone) and offline habits (more reading/focus)
- weekly review of data to see progress
- journal about why i relapse on certain days

results over 4 months:
- screen time: 7 hours/day → 2 hours/day
- phone pickups: 180/day → 50/day
- reading time: ~0 → 1-2 hours/day
- focused work: ~1 hour/day → 4-5 hours/day

digital minimalism isnt just about using phone less, its about replacing that time with better activities. you need to track both sides to make it stick.

blocking + tracking + replacement habits = sustainable digital minimalism
blocking alone = you'll just disable it eventually
