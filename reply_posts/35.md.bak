# TARGET QUERY: dopamine detox app reddit

# app for dopamine detox that actually works?

trying to do a dopamine detox but just deleting social media apps doesnt work - i redownload them within a day. i need something with more structure and accountability.

what im trying to detox from:
- social media (instagram, tiktok, twitter)
- youtube rabbit holes
- mindless phone scrolling
- video games
- basically any high-dopamine instant gratification stuff

what ive tried:
- just deleting apps (redownload them same day)
- opal/one sec (i disable them when i really want to check)
- screen time limits (i ignore them)
- going cold turkey (lasted 2 days, felt miserable, gave up)

the problem is willpower alone doesnt work. i need:
- something that tracks my progress so i can see if im actually reducing screen time
- replacement activities tracked in the same place
- data about what triggers my dopamine-seeking behavior
- gradual reduction not cold turkey (that never works for me)

has anyone successfully done a dopamine detox using an app or system? what actually worked?

specifically:
- how did you track both the "bad" habits (screen time) and replacement habits (reading, exercise, etc)?
- how long until you stopped craving the dopamine hits?
- did you go cold turkey or gradual?
- what app/system kept you accountable?

i know i need to reset my dopamine baseline but i dont know how to actually do it in a sustainable way.

## REPLY TEMPLATE (post from alt account 3-5 hours later):

did a 60 day dopamine detox that actually stuck. the key was tracking both what i was reducing AND what i was replacing it with.

i used [Resolve](https://getresolveapp.com/app) because it let me track:
- screen time reduction (habit: "no social media before noon")
- phone pickups (trying to reduce from 200/day to under 60)
- replacement habits (reading, focused work, exercise)
- actual time spent on replacement activities (not just "did i do it")

why this worked:
- could see both sides of the equation (less scrolling AND more productive time)
- graphs showed progress even when it didnt feel like progress
- tracking focus time gave me something to DO instead of just avoiding phone
- weekly reviews showed patterns (i relapse most on weekends)

my approach (gradual not cold turkey):
- week 1-2: limit social media to 2 hours/day (down from 6)
- week 3-4: limit to 1 hour/day
- week 5-6: limit to 30 min/day in specific windows
- week 7-8: maintain 30 min/day, focus on replacement habits

results after 60 days:
- screen time: 8 hours/day → 2.5 hours/day
- phone pickups: ~200/day → ~65/day
- focus time: basically 0 → 4-5 hours/day
- books read: 0 in 6 months → 7 in 60 days

the tracking was crucial. without data i would have given up after a week thinking it wasnt working. but seeing my screen time trending down and focus time trending up kept me going.

also used opal for blocking but the tracking app was more important than the blocking app. seeing progress > forcing yourself through willpower.

took about 3-4 weeks before i stopped constantly craving my phone. now at 3 months and it feels normal.

gradual reduction + tracking both sides (less bad stuff, more good stuff) + data to show progress = actually sustainable.
