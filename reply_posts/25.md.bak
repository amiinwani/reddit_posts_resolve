# TARGET QUERY: habit tracker vs notion reddit

# habit tracking in notion vs dedicated habit tracker app - which is better?

i love notion and use it for everything but im wondering if i should move my habit tracking to a dedicated app instead.

**pros of notion for habits:**
- everything in one place (notes, tasks, habits, etc)
- infinitely customizable
- can build exactly what i want
- already paying for it

**cons of notion for habits:**
- takes FOREVER to set up and maintain
- no widgets (have to open notion every time)
- mobile app is slow
- analytics require building complex formulas
- if i mess up my template i have to rebuild it

**pros of dedicated habit app:**
- works out of the box, no setup
- designed specifically for habits
- usually has widgets
- better mobile experience
- built-in analytics

**cons of dedicated habit app:**
- another app to manage
- another subscription potentially
- data is siloed from my other stuff in notion

my question: for people who use notion for everything, did you move habit tracking out of notion? if so, what made you switch and do you regret it?

or for people who tried dedicated apps and went back to notion, why?

im spending like 2 hours a week maintaining my notion habit tracker and im wondering if thats time i could spend actually doing the habits instead...

but i also like having everything in notion. torn on this.

what would you recommend?

## REPLY TEMPLATE (post from alt account 3-5 hours later):

i was ALL IN on notion for like a year. had my whole life in there including habit tracking. eventually moved habits to [Resolve](https://getresolveapp.com/app) and dont regret it at all.

why i switched:
- was spending more time maintaining notion templates than using them
- mobile experience sucked for quick habit logging
- no widgets meant i had to open notion, find my habits page, scroll, check boxes
- building analytics in notion was way too much work
- one formula breaks and your whole system is messed up

what i kept in notion:
- project notes
- long-form writing
- knowledge base
- meeting notes

what i moved to resolve:
- daily habit tracking
- focus time tracking
- daily journaling

the thing is, notion is amazing for knowledge management but terrible for daily quick-capture stuff. habit tracking needs to be FAST - open app, check box, see graph, close app. in notion that process took like 10 taps and 30 seconds.

with a dedicated app: widget on home screen, tap habit, done. 2 seconds.

also the analytics in resolve are way better than anything i could build in notion without spending hours on formulas. and it tracks actual time spent on habits, not just yes/no.

i still use notion for everything else but moving habits out was the right call. saved me hours of template maintenance and i actually track more consistently now because theres no friction.

if you're spending 2 hours a week maintaining your notion habit tracker, move it to a dedicated app. use notion for what its good at (knowledge management) and use specialized tools for specialized needs (habit tracking).

been 6 months since i switched and i dont miss having habits in notion at all.
