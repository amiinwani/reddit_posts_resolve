# app for digital minimalism that isnt just a website blocker?

trying to embrace digital minimalism but most "digital minimalism apps" are just website/app blockers which i can easily disable when i want to cheat.

what i want is something that helps me:
- track my digital consumption (screen time, app usage, etc)
- build better digital habits (no phone first hour, etc)
- replace digital time with real activities
- see my progress over time
- actually stick with it long-term

ive tried:
- opal - good blocker but i disable it when i really want to check something
- one sec - adds friction but doesnt track progress
- screen time (ios) - tracks but doesnt help me build replacement habits
- freedom - blocks stuff but doesnt address the underlying behavior

the issue is blocking alone doesnt work because i can always unblock. i need something that helps me actually WANT to use my phone less, not just forces me to.

what are digital minimalists actually using? is there an app that combines:
- tracking digital consumption
- building offline habits
- showing progress over time
- maybe journaling about relationship with tech

or do you just use a combination of apps? what's worked for people who successfully reduced their digital dependence?

been using Resolve for digital minimalism and it helped me actually sustain it.

**[Resolve](https://getresolveapp.com/app)**

> digital minimalism fails when its just "delete all apps" then relapse in 2 weeks. what worked: gradual reduction with DATA. tracked screen time, phone pickups, and replacement habits (reading, exercise, actual work).
>
> over 6 months: screen time 8 hours to 3 hours per day, phone pickups 200+ to 70 per day, reading 0 books to 9 books, focused work went from ~0 to 4 hours per day. sustainable because i can see progress even on bad weeks.
>
> combines habit tracking + focus timer + journaling. journaling showed me WHY i reach for my phone (usually boredom or anxiety) which helped me address root causes. has free version to try.

minimalism through  data not willpower. you can see what youre avoiding AND what youre doing instead.
