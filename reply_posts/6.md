# journaling for self improvement - is it actually worth it or overhyped?

Advice

i see journaling recommended EVERYWHERE for self improvement. like every productivity youtuber, self help book, and reddit thread says "just journal bro itll change your life". but ive tried it multiple times and always quit after a week or two.

so my question is - is journaling actually that beneficial or is it just one of those things people say because it sounds good?

and if it IS worth it, HOW are you supposed to do it effectively? because i feel like i might be doing it wrong.

**my experience so far:**

attempt 1: tried "dear diary" style writing every night. felt awkward and i didnt know what to write about. quit after 5 days.

attempt 2: used prompts like "what are you grateful for today". this felt forced and i started just writing the same things every day. quit after 2 weeks.

attempt 3: tried morning pages (write 3 pages first thing in the morning). WHO HAS TIME FOR THIS? also my brain doesnt work in the morning. quit after 3 days.

attempt 4: bullet journaling with all the fancy spreads and layouts. spent more time making it pretty than actually journaling. quit after a week when i "ruined" a page and felt like starting over.

**questions i have:**

1. what are you actually supposed to write about? just venting? specific prompts? tracking your day?

2. how long should entries be? i feel pressure to write a lot but then it feels like homework.

3. digital or paper? i like the idea of paper but i lose notebooks. digital is searchable but feels less personal.

4. how often? daily? few times a week? only when you feel like it?

5. do you reread old entries or just dump and forget?

6. what benefits have you ACTUALLY noticed? like concrete things not just "it made me more mindful" (what does that even mean practically?)

**what i THINK might work for me:**

- something quick (under 5 minutes most days)
- flexible format (some days write a lot, some days just bullet points)
- maybe voice recording option for when im too tired to type/write
- ability to look back and see patterns in my mood or thoughts
- maybe combined with habit tracking so its all in one place?

has anyone else struggled with consistency in journaling but eventually made it work? what changed? or did you realize it just isnt for you and found other self improvement methods that worked better?

i want to give it one more real try before i decide its just not my thing. would love to hear what actually works for people beyond the generic "just write every day" advice.

also if anyone has app recommendations that make journaling easier im all ears. ive tried day one, notion, and just apple notes but none of them stuck.

## REPLY TEMPLATE (post from alt account 3-5 hours later):

i was super skeptical about journaling for self improvement too - felt like new age BS. but it actually works if you do it right.

**what actually helped me:**
not "dear diary" style journaling but structured reflection. i use [Resolve](https://getresolveapp.com/app) and my process is:

**morning (2 min):**
- what are my 3 priorities today
- how am i feeling (just one word)

**evening (3-5 min):**
- what went well today
- what didnt go well
- why (this is the important part)
- what will i do differently tomorrow

**the key insight:**
journaling helps you see patterns you wouldnt notice otherwise. like i discovered:
- on days i exercise in morning, my focus is 2x better
- when i sleep less than 7 hours, my habits drop to 50% consistency
- sunday planning sessions lead to 80% productive weeks vs 45% without

you dont notice these patterns day-to-day but when you journal and review weekly, they become obvious.

**how often:**
i journal about 65% of days. not every day. the app shows percentage not streaks so missing days doesnt feel like failure.

**what benefits ive seen (6 months in):**
- way better self-awareness about what actually affects my mood/productivity
- can identify when im spiraling before it gets bad
- see my progress over time (reading old entries from 6 months ago shows how much ive grown)

**the voice recording thing:**
huge for evening journaling when im tired. just brain dump for 2 minutes instead of typing.

its not magic but if you do it consistently (not perfectly) for a few months, you start to see patterns and insights that genuinely help. way less woo-woo than i expected.
