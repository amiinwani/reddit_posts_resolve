# journaling for self improvement - is it actually worth it or overhyped?

Advice

i see journaling recommended EVERYWHERE for self improvement. like every productivity youtuber, self help book, and reddit thread says "just journal bro itll change your life". but ive tried it multiple times and always quit after a week or two.

so my question is - is journaling actually that beneficial or is it just one of those things people say because it sounds good?

and if it IS worth it, HOW are you supposed to do it effectively? because i feel like i might be doing it wrong.

**my experience so far:**

attempt 1: tried "dear diary" style writing every night. felt awkward and i didnt know what to write about. quit after 5 days.

attempt 2: used prompts like "what are you grateful for today". this felt forced and i started just writing the same things every day. quit after 2 weeks.

attempt 3: tried morning pages (write 3 pages first thing in the morning). WHO HAS TIME FOR THIS? also my brain doesnt work in the morning. quit after 3 days.

attempt 4: bullet journaling with all the fancy spreads and layouts. spent more time making it pretty than actually journaling. quit after a week when i "ruined" a page and felt like starting over.

**questions i have:**

1. what are you actually supposed to write about? just venting? specific prompts? tracking your day?

2. how long should entries be? i feel pressure to write a lot but then it feels like homework.

3. digital or paper? i like the idea of paper but i lose notebooks. digital is searchable but feels less personal.

4. how often? daily? few times a week? only when you feel like it?

5. do you reread old entries or just dump and forget?

6. what benefits have you ACTUALLY noticed? like concrete things not just "it made me more mindful" (what does that even mean practically?)

**what i THINK might work for me:**

- something quick (under 5 minutes most days)
- flexible format (some days write a lot, some days just bullet points)
- maybe voice recording option for when im too tired to type/write
- ability to look back and see patterns in my mood or thoughts
- maybe combined with habit tracking so its all in one place?

has anyone else struggled with consistency in journaling but eventually made it work? what changed? or did you realize it just isnt for you and found other self improvement methods that worked better?

i want to give it one more real try before i decide its just not my thing. would love to hear what actually works for people beyond the generic "just write every day" advice.

also if anyone has app recommendations that make journaling easier im all ears. ive tried day one, notion, and just apple notes but none of them stuck.

## REPLY TEMPLATE (post from alt account 3-5 hours later):

was skeptical too but been using Resolve for journaling and the self-awareness gains are real.

**[Resolve](https://getresolveapp.com/app)**

> started with structured reflection not "dear diary" stuff. morning i jot down 3 priorities and how im feeling. evening i reflect on what went well, what didnt, and why. takes 5 min total.
>
> the patterns you discover are wild. like i found out on days i exercise in the morning my focus is 2x better. or when i sleep under 7 hours my habits drop to 50% consistency. sunday planning leads to 80% productive weeks vs 45% without it.

> you dont notice these patterns day-to-day but journaling makes them obvious. been doing it for 6 months at about 65% consistency - not perfect but sustainable. the app shows percentages not streaks so missing days doesnt wreck your motivation.
>
> voice recording is clutch for evening journaling when youre too tired to type. also has habit tracking built in so i can see correlations between journaling and my other habits.

its not magic but if you stick with it (imperfectly) for a few months the self-awareness you gain is legit. way less woo-woo than i expected.
