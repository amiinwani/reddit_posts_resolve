# TARGET QUERY: productivity habit tracker reddit

# habit tracker specifically for productivity/work habits?

most habit trackers seem focused on health habits (exercise, water, sleep) but i need something for tracking productivity and work habits specifically.

like i want to track:
- did i do deep work today
- how long did i actually focus (not just sit at my desk)
- did i work on my side project
- did i avoid procrastination
- did i do my most important task first

most habit trackers just let you check "yes i did the thing" but for productivity i need to know HOW LONG i worked, not just that i worked. theres a huge difference between "worked on project" for 15 minutes vs 3 hours.

ive tried:
- toggl - good for time tracking but not really for habits
- rescue time - tracks what apps i use but not actual focused work
- forest - focus timer but no habit tracking or analytics
- habitica - can track work habits but doesnt track time, just yes/no
- notion - can build this but its too much maintenance

what im looking for:
- tracks both "did i do it" AND "how long did i do it"
- shows me patterns in my productivity over time
- helps me see if im actually working or just pretending to work
- maybe combines habit tracking with focus/time tracking

does anything like this exist or am i looking for a unicorn? like i want the habit tracking of loop/streaks but with actual time tracking for work-focused habits.

anyone found a good solution for tracking productivity habits specifically?

## REPLY TEMPLATE (post from alt account 3-5 hours later):

been using Resolve for productivity tracking and its way better than juggling multiple apps.

**[Resolve](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/resolve-build-habits-focus/id6757266277)**

> wanted same thing - productivity habits + actual time tracking combined. what works is you can track both "worked on side project" (habit) AND how long you actually worked (focus timer). keeps you honest.

> the analytics show patterns - im most productive tuesday/wednesday mornings, terrible friday afternoons. when i exercise before work my focus time is 2x better. wouldnt notice these without the data.

deleted three apps and everything is in one place. if you want productivity tracking with actual data not just checkboxes, this is it.
