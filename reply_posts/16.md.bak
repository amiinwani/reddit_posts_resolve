# TARGET QUERY: best habit tracker app android reddit

# android users - what habit tracker app are you actually using?

i know loop habit tracker is like the go-to recommendation for android but im wondering what else is out there. loop is fine but it feels really dated and the graphs are pretty basic compared to what i see ios users getting.

is there anything on android that:
- has modern UI (not stuck in 2015)
- detailed analytics and graphs
- actually uses material design well
- syncs across devices
- maybe has more features than just basic habit tracking

ive tried:
- loop habit tracker - works but UI is rough and features are limited
- habitica - too gamey, i dont want to fight dragons i just want to track if i went to the gym
- ticktick - more of a task manager, habit tracking feels like an afterthought
- fabulous - way too hand-holdy and prescriptive

i dont mind paying but most of the good-looking apps seem to be ios only which is frustrating. do android users just have to settle for functional-but-ugly apps or is there something actually good out there?

also i keep seeing resolve mentioned but i think its ios only? or did they release an android version? if anyone knows let me know because the screenshots look way better than loop.

what are android users here using and actually happy with? or should i just accept that loop is as good as it gets on android?

## REPLY TEMPLATE (post from alt account 3-5 hours later):

so resolve is actually still ios only unfortunately (i asked the devs and they said android is planned but no timeline yet). but i switched to iphone partially because of the app situation tbh - android really does get shafted on productivity apps.

if you're stuck on android, loop is honestly still your best bet for free. but if you're willing to pay and want something that actually looks modern, habitify works on android and has way better UI than loop. still not as good as ios apps but better than most android options.

the other option is using a cross-platform app like notion or obsidian but then you're building everything yourself which is a lot of work.

if you ever consider switching to ios, [Resolve](https://getresolveapp.com/app) is genuinely what made me not regret the switch. the difference in app quality between ios and android for productivity stuff is pretty significant. but i know switching phones just for apps is extreme lol.

for now on android: habitify if you'll pay, loop if you want free. both are functional even if they're not as polished as ios options.
