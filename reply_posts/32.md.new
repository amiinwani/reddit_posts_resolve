# TARGET QUERY: streak based habit tracker reddit

# are streak-based habit trackers actually helpful or do they make things worse?

ive noticed that every time i use a streak-based habit tracker, i end up quitting when i break the streak. like the whole point is to build long-term habits but the streak system seems to encourage all-or-nothing thinking.

what happens:
- build up a 20-30 day streak
- feel great about it
- miss ONE day for whatever reason
- streak resets to 0
- feel like i failed and lost all my progress
- lose motivation
- quit entirely

this has happened with streaks app, habitica, done, and even just using a paper calendar with Xs.

but everyone recommends "dont break the chain" and streak tracking. so is the problem the system or is it me?

questions:
- do streaks actually help you build habits or just create anxiety?
- is there a better way to track that doesnt make one missed day feel devastating?
- for people who successfully use streak tracking - how do you handle breaking streaks without quitting?
- are there habit trackers that focus on something other than streaks?

i want to build consistent habits but streak tracking seems to make me LESS consistent because i quit entirely when i break them. what am i missing?
