# best habit tracker for ios that actually takes advantage of ios features?

android users have loop habit tracker which everyone loves, but what's the ios equivalent? like i want something that actually uses ios features well - widgets, shortcuts, notifications that dont suck, etc.

i feel like a lot of habit trackers are just android apps ported to ios and they dont really feel native. or theyre cross-platform web apps that feel clunky on mobile.

what im looking for:
- actually designed for ios, not just a port
- good widgets (i want to track habits from home screen without opening app)
- works with shortcuts/automation if possible
- takes advantage of ios design language (not some generic material design app)
- smooth animations and gestures
- icloud sync would be nice

ive tried:
- streaks - this one actually feels native and looks great but its SO minimal. limited to 12 habits and basically no analytics
- productive - looks good but expensive subscription and honestly feels a bit bloated
- habitify - pretty ui but laggy sometimes and also subscription
- done - ok but nothing special about the ios integration

i dont mind paying a one-time fee but subscriptions are getting out of hand. already paying for icloud, apple music, and like 5 other things.

does anything exist that actually feels like a proper ios app with good widgets and shortcuts support? or should i just settle for streaks and accept that i wont get detailed analytics?

also saw resolve mentioned - anyone know if its actually built for ios or just another cross-platform thing? the screenshots look clean but cant tell if it actually uses ios features well.

what are ios users here actually using and happy with?

iOS user here and honestly this feels actually native not like an android port

**[Resolve](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/resolve-build-habits-focus/id6757266277)**

-- smooth animations, follows apple design language, widgets that actually look good, integrates with focus modes
-- combines habits + focus timer + journaling so deleted three apps
-- visual analytics kept me coming back. graphs showing consistency over months is way more motivating than streaks

been using 5 months at 81% consistency. feels like something apple would feature. has one-time purchase option so no subscription required.
