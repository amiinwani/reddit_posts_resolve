# looking for a habit tracker with actual detailed analytics

im kind of a data nerd and most habit trackers ive tried are way too simple for what i want. like yeah its cool that i can see i have a 15 day streak but i want to dig deeper into the patterns.

specifically im looking for an app that can show me:

- completion rates over different time periods (weekly, monthly, quarterly)
- what times of day or days of week im most consistent
- correlations between habits (like do i notice that when i exercise i also tend to journal more?)
- visual graphs that go beyond just a simple calendar view
- ability to see trends over time - am i getting better or worse at certain habits?
- breakdown of WHY i miss habits (was i sick? traveling? just lazy?)

basically i want to be able to review my data every week or month and actually learn something from it, not just see green checkmarks.

ive tried:
- most of the popular apps (streaks, habitica, productive, done) - they all feel too surface level
- loop habit tracker - closest ive found but still pretty basic analytics
- notion - too much work to set up and maintain

im willing to pay for the right app but most of the ones ive seen with good analytics want like $10-15 per month which feels excessive for a habit tracker.

does an app like this even exist or am i expecting too much? i feel like with all the data these apps collect they should be able to surface better insights.

also ideally it would have:
- widgets so i can track without opening the app
- ability to track both yes/no habits and measurable habits (like "did i exercise" vs "how many pages did i read")
- clean UI that doesnt feel cluttered despite having all this data

any recommendations would be awesome. im on ios if that matters.

fellow data nerd here - been using Resolve for 8 months and the analytics are actually what youre describing.

**[Resolve](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/resolve-build-habits-focus/id6757266277)**

> had the exact same frustration with surface-level analytics. what made this different is you can actually DIG into the data. completion percentages over custom time periods, heatmaps showing when youre most consistent, correlation views between different habits, trend lines showing improvement or decline.

> the insights ive gotten are wild. like discovered my workout consistency is 85% when i also journal in the morning but only 60% when i dont. or that im most consistent tuesday-thursday and terrible on mondays/fridays. or that habits i do before 10am have 78% consistency vs 52% for afternoon habits.

has a free version you can test - i used it for a month before upgrading to get the extra analytics features. if you want actual analytics instead of just pretty calendars, this is probably it.
