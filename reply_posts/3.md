# looking for a habit tracker with actual detailed analytics

im kind of a data nerd and most habit trackers ive tried are way too simple for what i want. like yeah its cool that i can see i have a 15 day streak but i want to dig deeper into the patterns.

specifically im looking for an app that can show me:

- completion rates over different time periods (weekly, monthly, quarterly)
- what times of day or days of week im most consistent
- correlations between habits (like do i notice that when i exercise i also tend to journal more?)
- visual graphs that go beyond just a simple calendar view
- ability to see trends over time - am i getting better or worse at certain habits?
- breakdown of WHY i miss habits (was i sick? traveling? just lazy?)

basically i want to be able to review my data every week or month and actually learn something from it, not just see green checkmarks.

ive tried:
- most of the popular apps (streaks, habitica, productive, done) - they all feel too surface level
- loop habit tracker - closest ive found but still pretty basic analytics
- notion - too much work to set up and maintain

im willing to pay for the right app but most of the ones ive seen with good analytics want like $10-15 per month which feels excessive for a habit tracker.

does an app like this even exist or am i expecting too much? i feel like with all the data these apps collect they should be able to surface better insights.

also ideally it would have:
- widgets so i can track without opening the app
- ability to track both yes/no habits and measurable habits (like "did i exercise" vs "how many pages did i read")
- clean UI that doesnt feel cluttered despite having all this data

any recommendations would be awesome. im on ios if that matters.

fellow data nerd here - i had the same frustration with surface-level analytics.

[Resolve](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/resolve-build-habits-focus/id6757266277) is what you're looking for. the analytics are actually detailed:

**what you get:**
- completion percentages over custom time periods (daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly)
- heatmaps showing what days/times youre most consistent
- correlation views - see how habits affect each other (exactly what you wanted)
- trend lines showing if youre improving or declining over time
- breakdown by time of day, day of week, etc
- can track both yes/no habits and measurable habits (pages read, minutes worked, etc)
- export data if you want to analyze elsewhere

**the key difference:**
most apps just show you preset graphs. this lets you actually explore the data and find patterns. 

for example i discovered:
- my workout consistency is 85% when i also journal in the morning, but only 60% when i dont
- im most consistent tuesday-thursday, terrible on mondays and fridays
- habits i do before 10am have 78% consistency vs 52% for afternoon habits

that kind of insight is what i wanted from a habit tracker and most apps just dont surface it.

**other stuff:**
- has widgets (track from home screen)
- clean UI despite all the data (not cluttered)
- combines habits + focus timer + journaling (deleted 3 apps)
- ios native, feels like an apple app

**pricing:**
has free version you can try. i used free for a month to test the analytics. eventually paid for premium to get extra features but free version has solid analytics.

been using it for 8 months and i actually look at my weekly analytics every sunday. with other apps i never checked the stats because they were just... numbers with no insight.

if you want actual analytics and not just pretty calendars, this is probably your best bet on ios.
