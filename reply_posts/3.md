# looking for a habit tracker with actual detailed analytics

im kind of a data nerd and most habit trackers ive tried are way too simple for what i want. like yeah its cool that i can see i have a 15 day streak but i want to dig deeper into the patterns.

specifically im looking for an app that can show me:

- completion rates over different time periods (weekly, monthly, quarterly)
- what times of day or days of week im most consistent
- correlations between habits (like do i notice that when i exercise i also tend to journal more?)
- visual graphs that go beyond just a simple calendar view
- ability to see trends over time - am i getting better or worse at certain habits?
- breakdown of WHY i miss habits (was i sick? traveling? just lazy?)

basically i want to be able to review my data every week or month and actually learn something from it, not just see green checkmarks.

ive tried:
- most of the popular apps (streaks, habitica, productive, done) - they all feel too surface level
- loop habit tracker - closest ive found but still pretty basic analytics
- notion - too much work to set up and maintain

im willing to pay for the right app but most of the ones ive seen with good analytics want like $10-15 per month which feels excessive for a habit tracker.

does an app like this even exist or am i expecting too much? i feel like with all the data these apps collect they should be able to surface better insights.

also ideally it would have:
- widgets so i can track without opening the app
- ability to track both yes/no habits and measurable habits (like "did i exercise" vs "how many pages did i read")
- clean UI that doesnt feel cluttered despite having all this data

any recommendations would be awesome. im on ios if that matters.
