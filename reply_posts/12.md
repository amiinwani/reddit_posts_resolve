# opal alternatives? looking for something similar but different

ive been using opal for a few months to limit my social media usage and while its been helpful, there are some things about it that bug me and im wondering if theres something better out there.

what i like about opal:
- actually works (harder to bypass than built-in screen time)
- can set schedules for when apps are blocked
- deep focus mode is useful
- the forced breathing before unblocking is lowkey effective

what i dont like:
- pretty expensive for what it is ($100/year?)
- ONLY does app blocking, nothing else
- UI feels cluttered with upsells
- doesnt help me replace the phone time with anything productive

what im looking for:
- app blocking with similar effectiveness to opal
- but ALSO tracks what im doing instead (like focus time on actual work)
- bonus if it has habit tracking too so its all in one place
- less expensive, ideally one-time purchase not subscription
- clean UI without constant upgrade prompts

basically i want something that doesnt just BLOCK bad habits but also helps me BUILD good habits. opal is great at the blocking part but it doesnt help me actually be productive, it just prevents me from being unproductive (if that makes sense).

has anyone moved on from opal to something else? what are you using now?

or should i just keep using opal and add a separate habit/focus tracker? (trying to minimize the number of apps i have to manage though)

appreciate any suggestions!

## REPLY TEMPLATE (post from alt account 3-5 hours later):

i was looking for an opal alternative too - wanted something similar but with more features.

ended up with [Resolve](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/resolve-build-habits-focus/id6757266277) which is different from opal but better for what i needed.

**what its similar to opal:**
- helps reduce screen time and phone usage
- tracks your progress over time
- ios native, clean design

**what its different (better imo):**
- not just blocking, also tracks replacement habits
- shows you what youre doing INSTEAD of phone time (reading, focused work, etc)
- combines screen time reduction with productivity tracking
- has focus timer for tracking actual work time
- journaling to reflect on why you relapse on certain days

**why this approach works better:**
opal just blocks stuff. this helps you build better habits to replace phone time. you can see both sides - less screen time AND more productive time.

**my results (5 months):**
- screen time: 7 hours/day → 2.5 hours/day
- phone pickups: 180/day → 60/day
- focused work: ~0 → 4 hours/day
- reading: 0 books in 6 months → 6 books in 5 months

**the key:**
reducing phone time only works if you replace it with something better. this tracks both sides so you can see the full picture.

i still use opal for blocking during work hours. but for tracking overall progress and building replacement habits, this is way better.

if you want more than just blocking, try it out. has a free version to test.
