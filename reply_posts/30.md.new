# TARGET QUERY: why habits don't stick reddit

# why do habits never stick for me even when i do everything "right"?

ive read atomic habits, tiny habits, the power of habit, and like 10 other books. i know the theory:
- start small
- habit stack
- make it obvious/easy/attractive/satisfying
- track your habits
- dont break the chain

but knowing the theory and actually making habits stick are apparently two different things because mine still dont stick.

what ive tried (that didnt work):
- starting with tiny habits (still quit after 2 weeks)
- habit stacking (still forgot to do them)
- making them obvious (put reminders everywhere, still ignored them)
- tracking with apps (tried 10+ apps, quit all of them)
- accountability (just felt guilty when i failed)
- identity-based habits (telling myself "im a person who exercises" didnt make me exercise)

the pattern is always:
1. read about habits, get motivated
2. start new habit with perfect system
3. do great for 1-2 weeks
4. life gets busy or i get tired
5. miss a day or two
6. feel like i failed
7. quit entirely
8. repeat 2 months later

at this point ive "started" exercising like 30 times. ive "started" journaling 20 times. ive "started" meditating 15 times. nothing sticks past a few weeks.

is there something fundamentally wrong with how i approach this? am i missing something obvious? or are some people just not wired for habits?

genuinely asking - for people who successfully built lasting habits after years of failure, what was the actual turning point? not the theory, but the real thing that made it click?
