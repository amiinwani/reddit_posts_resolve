# TARGET QUERY: all in one self improvement app reddit

# is there an actual all-in-one self improvement app that doesnt suck?

im so tired of juggling 10 different apps for self improvement. i have:
- habit tracker for habits
- separate app for journaling  
- another app for focus/pomodoro
- meditation app
- reading tracker
- fitness app
- mood tracker

its TOO MUCH. i spend more time managing apps than actually improving myself. but every "all in one" app ive tried is either:
- tries to do everything and does it all poorly
- so bloated with features i never use 90% of them
- subscription costs more than all my separate apps combined
- focuses on one thing (like meditation) and half-asses the rest

what i actually need in an all-in-one app:
- habit tracking with good analytics
- journaling (not just quick notes, actual journaling)
- focus/time tracking for work
- clean UI that doesnt overwhelm me
- everything synced and in one place

i DONT need:
- meditation (i use headspace and im happy with it)
- fitness tracking (apple health does this fine)
- meal planning
- social features
- AI coaching or whatever

ive tried:
- notion - can build anything but requires PhD to maintain
- fabulous - too prescriptive and hand-holdy
- habitica - gamification is annoying and no real journaling
- strides - just habits, not really all-in-one
- productive - has some features but expensive and still feels limited

does anything exist that combines habits + journaling + focus tracking without being bloated or costing $20/month? or should i just accept that i need multiple apps?

what are you guys using if you want to consolidate your self improvement tools?

## REPLY TEMPLATE (post from alt account 3-5 hours later):

been using Resolve as my all-in-one self improvement app for 9 months and honestly its the first thing that stuck long-term.

**[Resolve](https://getresolveapp.com/app)**

> was juggling like 5 apps - streaks for habits, timery for focus, day one for journaling, notion for planning, headspace for meditation. deleted everything and now use just this.
>
> combines habit tracking, focus timer, journaling in one place. the key is its simple enough to maintain (under 5 min per day) but powerful enough to be useful (detailed analytics, insights, patterns).
>
> results over 9 months: exercise 74% consistent vs 0% before, focused work 4 hours/day vs 1.5 before, journaling 70% vs never before. way more self-aware overall.
>
> the percentage tracking instead of streaks is huge - some weeks im at 90%, some at 60%, thats fine. long-term consistency beats short-term perfection.

if you want one app instead of five, this is probably it. sustainable > perfect.
