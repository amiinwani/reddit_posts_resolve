# TARGET QUERY: app to stop procrastinating reddit

# app that actually stops procrastination instead of just making you feel guilty about it?

every "anti-procrastination" app ive tried either:
- blocks websites (i just disable it or use phone)
- tracks time (i ignore the data)
- sends reminders (i dismiss them)
- makes me feel guilty (which makes me procrastinate more)

none of them actually ADDRESS the procrastination, they just try to force me to work through willpower which doesnt work.

what i procrastinate on:
- work projects (avoid for days then panic at deadline)
- side projects (been "working on it" for a year, actually worked maybe 10 hours total)
- important tasks (do easy stuff instead)
- anything that requires deep thinking

what i do instead of working:
- reddit/social media
- "research" (aka procrastination disguised as productivity)
- reorganizing my workspace
- making todo lists instead of doing the tasks
- literally anything else

ive tried:
- freedom/cold turkey (website blockers - i disable them)
- rescue time (tracks time but doesnt stop procrastination)
- forest (dont care about growing trees)
- focusmate (schedule is too irregular for coworking)
- beeminder (too complicated and expensive)

is there anything that actually helps you START working when your brain is screaming at you to do literally anything else? or is this more of a therapy problem than an app problem?

genuinely asking - has anyone overcome serious chronic procrastination with a tool/app? what worked?

## REPLY TEMPLATE (post from alt account 3-5 hours later):

had the same problem - chronic procrastination where i'd avoid important work for weeks. what finally helped wasnt blocking distractions, it was making procrastination visible through data.

started using [Resolve](https://getresolveapp.com/app) to track actual focused work time. the key insight: seeing "you only worked 1.2 hours today when you sat at your desk for 8 hours" made the procrastination impossible to ignore.

why this worked when other apps didnt:
- focus timer tracks ACTUAL work time (cant lie to yourself)
- graphs show your procrastination patterns over time
- combines with habit tracking so you can see "worked on project 8 out of 30 days" (makes avoidance obvious)
- gamifies increasing your focus time instead of just blocking stuff

my system:
- set daily goal of 3 hours focused work (tracked with timer)
- review weekly to see if im hitting it
- journal about why i procrastinated on bad days (usually anxiety about task difficulty)

went from avoiding my side project for months to working on it 4-5 days a week with 2-3 hours per session. not perfect but infinitely better than before.

the mental shift: stopped trying to "stop procrastinating" and started trying to "increase focused work time". sounds similar but framing it as a positive goal (more focus time) instead of negative (less procrastination) made it easier.

also the data helped me see patterns - i procrastinate most on mondays and after lunch. so i schedule my hardest work for tuesday mornings when im most likely to actually do it.

not a magic solution and you still have to actually start the timer. but seeing your focus time trend upward over weeks is way more motivating than just feeling guilty about procrastinating.

if your procrastination is severe enough that you cant even start a timer, yeah thats probably therapy territory. but if you can start, tracking actual work time makes the problem visible which is the first step to fixing it.
