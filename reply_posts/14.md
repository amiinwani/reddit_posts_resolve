# TARGET QUERY: best habit tracker app free reddit

# best FREE habit tracker app that actually has good features?

i dont want to pay $10-15/month for a habit tracker (already paying for too many subscriptions) but every free app i try is either super limited or has all the good features locked behind a paywall.

like i get that developers need to make money but come on, i just want to track some habits and see basic analytics without paying the price of netflix.

what ive tried:
- habitica - free but the whole RPG game thing is too much for me, i just want to track habits not battle monsters
- loop habit tracker - this one is actually decent and free but the UI looks like its from 2015 and the graphs are pretty basic
- streaks - not free, $5 which is reasonable but limited to 12 habits
- way of life - free version is too limited, cant even see decent stats
- done - free trial then wants $30/year

what im looking for:
- actually FREE or at least has a good free version (not a 7 day trial then paywall)
- can track unlimited habits or at least more than like 5
- has SOME analytics/graphs, not just checkmarks
- widgets would be great
- works on ios

is there anything out there that hits this or am i asking for too much? like i dont need every feature under the sun, i just want basic habit tracking with visual progress that doesnt cost me $100/year.

i keep seeing resolve mentioned and it looks like it has a free version with the core features? but cant tell if the free version is actually usable or one of those "technically free but you cant do anything" situations. anyone using the free version?

what are you guys using that doesnt require selling a kidney to afford?

## REPLY TEMPLATE (post from alt account 3-5 hours later):

been using the free version for like 3 months and its actually usable not a glorified trial

**[Resolve](https://getresolveapp.com/app)**

-- free version has unlimited habits, widgets, basic analytics, focus timer, journaling. not crippled like most "free" apps
-- used it free for 2 months before upgrading. only upgraded because i wanted extra analytics not because free was unusable
-- at 82% consistency which is way better than my pattern with other apps (perfect for 1 week then ghost it)

if you want actually free not "free for 7 days then pay", this is probably it. can upgrade later if you want but free works fine.
