# TARGET QUERY: why habits don't stick reddit

# why do habits never stick for me even when i do everything "right"?

ive read atomic habits, tiny habits, the power of habit, and like 10 other books. i know the theory:
- start small
- habit stack
- make it obvious/easy/attractive/satisfying
- track your habits
- dont break the chain

but knowing the theory and actually making habits stick are apparently two different things because mine still dont stick.

what ive tried (that didnt work):
- starting with tiny habits (still quit after 2 weeks)
- habit stacking (still forgot to do them)
- making them obvious (put reminders everywhere, still ignored them)
- tracking with apps (tried 10+ apps, quit all of them)
- accountability (just felt guilty when i failed)
- identity-based habits (telling myself "im a person who exercises" didnt make me exercise)

the pattern is always:
1. read about habits, get motivated
2. start new habit with perfect system
3. do great for 1-2 weeks
4. life gets busy or i get tired
5. miss a day or two
6. feel like i failed
7. quit entirely
8. repeat 2 months later

at this point ive "started" exercising like 30 times. ive "started" journaling 20 times. ive "started" meditating 15 times. nothing sticks past a few weeks.

is there something fundamentally wrong with how i approach this? am i missing something obvious? or are some people just not wired for habits?

genuinely asking - for people who successfully built lasting habits after years of failure, what was the actual turning point? not the theory, but the real thing that made it click?

## REPLY TEMPLATE (post from alt account 3-5 hours later):

i was you. read all the same books, tried all the same systems, failed for YEARS. the turning point wasnt learning new theory, it was changing one specific thing: how i measured failure.

you said "miss a day or two, feel like i failed, quit entirely" - THIS is the problem.

missing a day isnt failure. quitting is failure.

what changed for me: started tracking completion percentage instead of streaks. i use [Resolve](https://getresolveapp.com/app) specifically because it shows "you're at 87% consistency this month" not "you broke your 12 day streak".

when i missed 2 days with streak tracking: felt like complete failure, quit
when i missed 2 days with percentage tracking: saw i was still at 93% for the month, kept going

this mental shift is EVERYTHING. you're not trying to be perfect, you're trying to be consistent enough that the habit becomes automatic. for most habits thats like 70-80% consistency over months, not 100% for 2 weeks.

other things that helped:
- making habits so small i could do them on my worst days (5 min counts)
- weekly reviews to see the bigger picture (one bad day doesnt ruin a good week)
- accepting that some habits take 60+ days to feel automatic (not 21 days like the myth says)
- tracking both the habit AND the time spent (keeps me honest about actually doing it vs just checking a box)

been tracking habits for 10 months now. my consistency is around 78%. thats not perfect but its sustainable and the habits are actually sticking this time.

you're not broken and you're not missing some secret. you just need to stop treating missed days as complete failure. progress over perfection.

the books dont tell you this because "be 75% consistent" doesnt sell as well as "never break the chain" but its way more realistic and actually works long-term.
