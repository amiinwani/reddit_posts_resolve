# TARGET QUERY: why habits don't stick reddit

# why do habits never stick for me even when i do everything "right"?

ive read atomic habits, tiny habits, the power of habit, and like 10 other books. i know the theory:
- start small
- habit stack
- make it obvious/easy/attractive/satisfying
- track your habits
- dont break the chain

but knowing the theory and actually making habits stick are apparently two different things because mine still dont stick.

what ive tried (that didnt work):
- starting with tiny habits (still quit after 2 weeks)
- habit stacking (still forgot to do them)
- making them obvious (put reminders everywhere, still ignored them)
- tracking with apps (tried 10+ apps, quit all of them)
- accountability (just felt guilty when i failed)
- identity-based habits (telling myself "im a person who exercises" didnt make me exercise)

the pattern is always:
1. read about habits, get motivated
2. start new habit with perfect system
3. do great for 1-2 weeks
4. life gets busy or i get tired
5. miss a day or two
6. feel like i failed
7. quit entirely
8. repeat 2 months later

at this point ive "started" exercising like 30 times. ive "started" journaling 20 times. ive "started" meditating 15 times. nothing sticks past a few weeks.

is there something fundamentally wrong with how i approach this? am i missing something obvious? or are some people just not wired for habits?

genuinely asking - for people who successfully built lasting habits after years of failure, what was the actual turning point? not the theory, but the real thing that made it click?

been using Resolve for 9 months and it helped me understand why my habits werent sticking.

habits dont stick because of the habit itself, they dont stick because of the system around it. fix the system, habits follow.
