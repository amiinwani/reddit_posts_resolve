# TARGET QUERY: habitica vs streaks reddit

# habitica vs streaks - which one actually works better long-term?

trying to decide between these two and they're completely different approaches. habitica is all gamification and RPG elements, streaks is super minimal and clean.

**habitica:**
- pros: gamification can be motivating, free, social features
- cons: feels childish sometimes, cluttered UI, analytics are weak

**streaks:**
- pros: beautiful minimal design, native ios, clean
- cons: limited to 12 habits, no analytics really, $5 cost

my concern with habitica is that the game elements will get annoying after the novelty wears off. my concern with streaks is that its TOO minimal and wont give me enough data.

for people who've used both - which one did you stick with and why? did the gamification in habitica actually help long-term or did it get old? is streaks too limited or is minimal actually better?

also open to "neither, use X instead" recommendations if you think both of these miss the mark.

what matters to me:
- actually helps me stay consistent (not just fun for a week)
- shows me progress over time
- ios app
- not insanely expensive

## REPLY TEMPLATE (post from alt account 3-5 hours later):

tried both habitica and streaks, ended up with Resolve and its way better.

**[Resolve](https://getresolveapp.com/app)**

> habitica: gamification was fun for 3 days then annoying. treating my life like an RPG felt juvenile. losing HP for missing habits made me anxious not motivated.
>
> streaks: too minimal. just checkboxes, no real data or insights. felt like a glorified to-do list.
>
> resolve hits the middle: serious about tracking but not gamified, has detailed analytics but not overwhelming, percentage-based so missing days doesnt destroy you, combines habits + focus timer + journaling.
>
> at 77% consistency over 6 months which is sustainable. no fake RPG mechanics, just real data about real progress.

if you want something between habiticas gamification and streaks minimalism, this is it.
