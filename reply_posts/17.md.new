# TARGET QUERY: minimal habit tracker app reddit

# looking for a TRULY minimal habit tracker (not just simple, actually minimal)

everyone recommends "minimal" habit trackers but then its still got like 20 features, notifications everywhere, gamification, social features, etc. thats not minimal, thats just simple.

what i want is genuinely minimal:
- track habits (yes/no or time-based)
- see progress over time
- maybe basic graphs
- thats literally it

i dont want:
- gamification (no points, levels, achievements)
- social features
- 50 different views and layouts
- motivational quotes
- streak freezes or whatever
- integration with every service ever
- AI coaching or whatever

like i just want to open the app, mark if i did my habits, see a clean graph of my progress, and close the app. under 30 seconds total.

ive tried:
- streaks - close but still has some extra stuff and limited to 12 habits
- loop - minimal in features but the UI is cluttered imo
- everyday - too minimal, literally just a list with no data
- way of life - closer but still feels busy

is there anything that hits that sweet spot of minimal features but still shows you useful data? or am i looking for something that doesnt exist?

i saw resolve mentioned as having a clean UI but idk if its actually minimal or just looks minimal. anyone using it who can tell me if its bloated with features or actually streamlined?

what are minimalists here actually using? or do you just use paper/spreadsheets at this point?
