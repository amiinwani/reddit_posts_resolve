# TARGET QUERY: identity based habits reddit

# how do identity-based habits actually work in practice?

read atomic habits and the whole "identity-based habits" concept makes sense in theory - become the type of person who does X instead of trying to do X.

but in practice i dont know how to actually implement this. like:

saying "im a person who exercises" doesnt make me exercise
saying "im a writer" doesnt make me write
saying "im disciplined" doesnt give me discipline

what am i missing? how do you actually shift your identity vs just saying words that dont feel true?

my confusion:
- do you fake it till you make it? (feels dishonest)
- do you wait until you have evidence before claiming the identity? (chicken and egg problem)
- how do you believe the identity when your behavior contradicts it?
- is there a specific process or is it just mindset?

examples of what hasnt worked:
- telling myself "im a runner" while not running (felt like lying)
- trying to "be" disciplined without doing disciplined things (didnt work)
- visualizing my ideal identity (motivating for 1 day then forgotten)

for people who successfully used identity-based habits:
- how did you actually shift your identity?
- how long until the identity felt real vs aspirational?
- did you use any specific techniques or tools?
- how do you handle the gap between current behavior and desired identity?

i want to understand the actual implementation, not just the theory. what does this look like day-to-day?
