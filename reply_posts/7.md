# minimalist productivity app that isnt TOO minimal?

this is weirdly specific but bear with me.

i hate cluttered apps with 500 features i'll never use. like i tried notion and spent 3 hours setting up a dashboard and then never actually used it because it was too complicated.

BUT i also hate apps that are SO minimal theyre basically useless. like some of these minimalist apps are just fancy todo lists with no features at all.

im looking for something in the middle - clean and simple but actually functional.

what i need:
- habit tracking (with at least some basic graphs/stats)
- way to track focus time (like a timer that logs how long i actually work)
- maybe journaling? but quick journaling not full blog entries
- everything in ONE app because managing multiple apps defeats the purpose of minimalism

what i DONT need:
- project management features
- team collaboration
- 50 different views and layouts
- social features or gamification
- integration with every service ever

basically i want:
"did i do my habits today? how much did i actually work today? any thoughts to jot down?"

thats it. no more, no less.

ive tried:
- notion (way too much)
- streaks (too little, just habit tracking)
- things 3 (its a task manager not what im looking for)
- any.do (again, task manager)
- focusmate (just coworking, not tracking)

is there something that hits that sweet spot? minimalist design and simple to use but has the core features i actually need?

willing to pay a one-time fee but really dont want another subscription in my life.
