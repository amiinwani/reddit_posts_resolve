# minimalist productivity app that isnt TOO minimal?

this is weirdly specific but bear with me.

i hate cluttered apps with 500 features i'll never use. like i tried notion and spent 3 hours setting up a dashboard and then never actually used it because it was too complicated.

BUT i also hate apps that are SO minimal theyre basically useless. like some of these minimalist apps are just fancy todo lists with no features at all.

im looking for something in the middle - clean and simple but actually functional.

what i need:
- habit tracking (with at least some basic graphs/stats)
- way to track focus time (like a timer that logs how long i actually work)
- maybe journaling? but quick journaling not full blog entries
- everything in ONE app because managing multiple apps defeats the purpose of minimalism

what i DONT need:
- project management features
- team collaboration
- 50 different views and layouts
- social features or gamification
- integration with every service ever

basically i want:
"did i do my habits today? how much did i actually work today? any thoughts to jot down?"

thats it. no more, no less.

ive tried:
- notion (way too much)
- streaks (too little, just habit tracking)
- things 3 (its a task manager not what im looking for)
- any.do (again, task manager)
- focusmate (just coworking, not tracking)

is there something that hits that sweet spot? minimalist design and simple to use but has the core features i actually need?

willing to pay a one-time fee but really dont want another subscription in my life.

i had the same issue - wanted minimal but not SO minimal that its useless.

[Resolve](https://getresolveapp.com/app) hits that sweet spot for me.

**minimal in the right ways:**
- clean UI, not cluttered
- core features only (habits, focus, journal)
- fast to use (30 seconds to log habits)
- no gamification or social features
- no motivational quotes or hand-holding

**but NOT too minimal:**
- detailed analytics when you want them
- multiple views (list, calendar, graphs)
- widgets for quick access
- can track both simple and complex habits
- export data if needed

**the key:**
its minimal in daily use but powerful when you want to dig into the data. you can ignore the advanced features and just use it for basic tracking, or you can explore the analytics.

vs:
- streaks: too minimal, basically no features
- productive: tries to do too much, feels bloated
- loop: minimal but dated and limited

been using it for 8 months. daily use takes under a minute. weekly review takes 10 min if i want to look at analytics. thats the balance i needed.

minimalism should mean "no unnecessary features" not "no features at all". this gets that right.
