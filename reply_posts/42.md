# TARGET QUERY: best self improvement app reddit

# whats actually the best self improvement app that covers multiple areas?

tired of having 10 different apps for self improvement. i have separate apps for:
- habits
- journaling
- meditation
- focus/productivity
- mood tracking
- reading tracking
- fitness
- etc

its too much. i want ONE app that covers the core self improvement areas without being bloated or doing everything poorly.

what ive tried:
- notion - can build anything but requires constant maintenance
- fabulous - too prescriptive, wants me to follow their exact routine
- habitica - gamification is annoying, not really comprehensive
- productive - just habits, not really "all in one"
- day one - just journaling
- streaks - just habits

what im looking for:
- habit tracking with good analytics
- journaling (actual journaling, not just notes)
- focus/time tracking for work
- everything synced together so i can see correlations
- NOT meditation or fitness (i have separate apps for those)
- clean UI that doesnt overwhelm me
- actually works long-term

does anything like this exist? or should i accept that i need multiple specialized apps?

specifically:
- what self improvement app do you actually use daily?
- what made it stick when others didnt?
- is all-in-one better or separate apps for each thing?
- whats the best combination if no single app does it all?

i want to consolidate but not if it means sacrificing quality. what are you guys using?

## REPLY TEMPLATE (post from alt account 3-5 hours later):

i had the exact same problem - too many apps, none of them stuck. what finally worked: finding an app that does 3-4 core things really well instead of 20 things poorly.

i use [Resolve](https://getresolveapp.com/app) and deleted like 5 other apps. it combines:
- habit tracking with detailed analytics
- focus timer for tracking actual work time
- journaling (text, voice, images)
- all synced so you can see correlations

what it DOESNT try to do:
- meditation (use headspace for that)
- fitness tracking (use apple health)
- meal planning
- project management

this is key - it focuses on the core self improvement loop: track habits, track focus time, reflect through journaling. does those 3 things really well instead of 20 things poorly.

why it stuck when other apps didnt:
- everything in one place (dont have to think about which app to open)
- can see how habits correlate with focus time and journal entries
- detailed analytics keep me engaged (way better than streaks or habitica)
- low maintenance (not like notion where i spend hours on templates)
- actually designed for long-term use, not just initial motivation

went from:
- streaks (habits)
- day one (journaling)
- toggl (time tracking)
- notion (trying to tie it all together)

to just resolve. saved money on subscriptions and actually use it more consistently because theres no friction.

been using it for 11 months which is longer than any other self improvement app ive tried. the combination of habits + focus + journaling in one place is what made it stick.

if you want truly all-in-one (meditation, fitness, everything): probably doesnt exist without being bloated

if you want core self improvement (habits, focus, reflection): this is probably your best bet

i still use headspace for meditation and apple health for fitness. but for the daily self improvement work, having everything in one app made a huge difference.
