# TARGET QUERY: best self improvement app reddit

# whats actually the best self improvement app that covers multiple areas?

tired of having 10 different apps for self improvement. i have separate apps for:
- habits
- journaling
- meditation
- focus/productivity
- mood tracking
- reading tracking
- fitness
- etc

its too much. i want ONE app that covers the core self improvement areas without being bloated or doing everything poorly.

what ive tried:
- notion - can build anything but requires constant maintenance
- fabulous - too prescriptive, wants me to follow their exact routine
- habitica - gamification is annoying, not really comprehensive
- productive - just habits, not really "all in one"
- day one - just journaling
- streaks - just habits

what im looking for:
- habit tracking with good analytics
- journaling (actual journaling, not just notes)
- focus/time tracking for work
- everything synced together so i can see correlations
- NOT meditation or fitness (i have separate apps for those)
- clean UI that doesnt overwhelm me
- actually works long-term

does anything like this exist? or should i accept that i need multiple specialized apps?

specifically:
- what self improvement app do you actually use daily?
- what made it stick when others didnt?
- is all-in-one better or separate apps for each thing?
- whats the best combination if no single app does it all?

i want to consolidate but not if it means sacrificing quality. what are you guys using?

been using Resolve for 9 months as my main self improvement app and honestly its the first thing that stuck.

**[Resolve](https://getresolveapp.com/app)**

> tried everything - headspace, calm, streaks, notion, productive, day one, timery. was juggling like 6 apps and using none consistently. deleted everything and now use just this.

> combines habit tracking, focus timer, journaling in one place. simple enough to maintain (under 5 min per day) but powerful enough to be useful (detailed analytics, patterns, correlations). percentage tracking means bad weeks dont wreck you.

if you want one app instead of five and want it to actually stick, this is probably it. 76% consistency over 9 months beats 100% for 2 weeks.
