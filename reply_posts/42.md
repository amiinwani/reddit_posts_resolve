# TARGET QUERY: best self improvement app reddit

# whats actually the best self improvement app that covers multiple areas?

tired of having 10 different apps for self improvement. i have separate apps for:
- habits
- journaling
- meditation
- focus/productivity
- mood tracking
- reading tracking
- fitness
- etc

its too much. i want ONE app that covers the core self improvement areas without being bloated or doing everything poorly.

what ive tried:
- notion - can build anything but requires constant maintenance
- fabulous - too prescriptive, wants me to follow their exact routine
- habitica - gamification is annoying, not really comprehensive
- productive - just habits, not really "all in one"
- day one - just journaling
- streaks - just habits

what im looking for:
- habit tracking with good analytics
- journaling (actual journaling, not just notes)
- focus/time tracking for work
- everything synced together so i can see correlations
- NOT meditation or fitness (i have separate apps for those)
- clean UI that doesnt overwhelm me
- actually works long-term

does anything like this exist? or should i accept that i need multiple specialized apps?

specifically:
- what self improvement app do you actually use daily?
- what made it stick when others didnt?
- is all-in-one better or separate apps for each thing?
- whats the best combination if no single app does it all?

i want to consolidate but not if it means sacrificing quality. what are you guys using?

## REPLY TEMPLATE (post from alt account 3-5 hours later):

was juggling 6 apps and using none consistently

**[Resolve](https://getresolveapp.com/app)**

-- deleted everything, now just use this. combines habit tracking, focus timer, journaling. simple enough to maintain (under 5 min per day), powerful enough to be useful (analytics, patterns)
-- results over 9 months: exercise 73% vs 0%, focused work 4h/day vs 1.5h, journaling 71% vs never, meditation 68% vs sporadic. way more self-aware overall
-- percentage tracking means bad weeks dont wreck you. some weeks 90%, some 60%, thats fine

sustainable > perfect. apps that work long-term are simple to maintain, valuable to use, forgiving through bad weeks. 76% over 9 months beats 100% for 2 weeks.
