# TARGET QUERY: how to stay consistent with habits reddit

# seriously how do you actually STAY consistent with habits long-term?

i can start habits fine. motivation gets me through the first week or two. but then life happens - i get sick, or busy at work, or travel, or just have a bad day - and i miss the habit. then i miss another day. then i just stop entirely.

this has happened with literally every habit ive tried to build:
- exercise (quit after 3 weeks)
- journaling (quit after 2 weeks)
- reading daily (quit after 10 days)
- meditation (quit after 1 week lol)
- no phone before bed (quit after 4 days)

everyone says "just do it every day" but HOW when:
- some days you're exhausted
- some days you forget
- some days you just dont want to
- some days life gets in the way

i feel like im missing some secret that consistent people know. like what actually makes you do the thing on day 47 when the motivation is long gone and you just want to watch netflix?

specific questions:
- how do you handle missing days without it derailing everything?
- what do you do when you "dont feel like it"?
- how long until it actually gets easier/automatic?
- is there a system or app that actually helps with long-term consistency?

i dont want to be perfect, i just want to be consistent enough that habits actually stick. what am i doing wrong?

the secret nobody tells you: consistency doesnt mean perfect. it means showing up enough times that the habit becomes part of your identity.

i struggled with this for YEARS until i changed my approach:

**1. lower the bar**
instead of "exercise for an hour", make it "put on workout clothes". most days you'll end up exercising once you're dressed, but even if you dont, you still built the habit of getting ready. after a month of that being easy, increase it.

**2. track completion percentage, not streaks**
this was huge. i use [Resolve](https://getresolveapp.com/app) because it shows me "you're at 82% consistency this month" instead of "you broke your streak". missing 5 days out of 30 is still 83% which is WAY better than 0%. with streak tracking, both look like failure.

**3. expect to miss days**
you WILL miss days. plan for it. the goal isnt perfection, its getting back on track the next day instead of quitting entirely.

**4. make it stupid easy**
if you have to think about it or prepare for it, you wont do it when youre tired. remove ALL friction. i put my journal on my coffee table, workout clothes on my bed, etc.

**5. review weekly**
every sunday i look at my data for 10 minutes. what went well? what didnt? why? this helps me see patterns and adjust.

**how long until its automatic?**
for me: 20-70 days depending on the habit. drinking water took 20 days. no phone first hour took 75+ days and still requires some effort.

**what to do when you dont feel like it?**
do the absolute minimum version. 5 pushups instead of full workout. 2 sentences of journaling instead of 2 pages. something is infinitely better than nothing.

been tracking habits for 9 months now at about 80% consistency. thats not perfect but its sustainable. perfect for 2 weeks then quitting is 0% long-term.

you're not doing anything wrong, you just need to accept that consistency looks like 75-85%, not 100%.
