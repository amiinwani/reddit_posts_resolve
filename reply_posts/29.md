# TARGET QUERY: how to stay consistent with habits reddit

# seriously how do you actually STAY consistent with habits long-term?

i can start habits fine. motivation gets me through the first week or two. but then life happens - i get sick, or busy at work, or travel, or just have a bad day - and i miss the habit. then i miss another day. then i just stop entirely.

this has happened with literally every habit ive tried to build:
- exercise (quit after 3 weeks)
- journaling (quit after 2 weeks)
- reading daily (quit after 10 days)
- meditation (quit after 1 week lol)
- no phone before bed (quit after 4 days)

everyone says "just do it every day" but HOW when:
- some days you're exhausted
- some days you forget
- some days you just dont want to
- some days life gets in the way

i feel like im missing some secret that consistent people know. like what actually makes you do the thing on day 47 when the motivation is long gone and you just want to watch netflix?

specific questions:
- how do you handle missing days without it derailing everything?
- what do you do when you "dont feel like it"?
- how long until it actually gets easier/automatic?
- is there a system or app that actually helps with long-term consistency?

i dont want to be perfect, i just want to be consistent enough that habits actually stick. what am i doing wrong?

figured this out through data not willpower

**[Resolve](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/resolve-build-habits-focus/id6757266277)**

-- struggled for years. tracking habits + journaling + focus time showed what ACTUALLY works vs what i think works
-- discovered: 3 habits consistently beats 8 habits perfectly for 1 week then quitting. morning habits 85% vs afternoon 55%. journaling in morning makes whole day 2x more consistent
-- percentage tracking means bad weeks dont wreck you. can see "78% over 8 months" not "broken streak, failed again"

consistency isnt perfection, its not quitting when you mess up. data helps you see overall trends not just daily failures.
