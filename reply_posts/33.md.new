# TARGET QUERY: best procrastination app reddit

# what app actually helps with procrastination (not just time blocking)?

i procrastinate on everything important and time blocking apps dont help because i just... dont start the timer. i need something that addresses the actual procrastination problem, not just time management.

what doesnt work for me:
- pomodoro apps (i dont start the timer)
- website blockers (i disable them or use my phone)
- to-do lists (i make them then ignore them)
- calendar blocking (i just dont do the thing i scheduled)

the issue isnt that i dont know WHAT to do or WHEN to do it. the issue is i avoid doing it entirely. i'll sit at my desk "working" for 8 hours but only actually work for like 1.5 hours because i keep finding ways to procrastinate.

what i think i need:
- tracks ACTUAL work time (not just time at desk)
- shows me data about my procrastination patterns
- makes it harder to lie to myself about working vs procrastinating
- maybe helps break work into smaller chunks
- accountability without making me feel like crap

has anyone actually overcome serious procrastination with an app? not just "helped me focus a bit" but like chronic avoidance of important work?

what tools or systems have worked for people with real procrastination problems?
