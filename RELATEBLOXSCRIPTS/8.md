# SCRIPT 3 - VARIATION 2

## SCRIPT
WHY does being WATCHED make me forget basic human functions?

Nobody is looking at me: I am walking like a NORMAL person.

Someone makes eye contact: I am suddenly a BROKEN NPC.

My brain PANICS.

"Abort mission! We do not know how to walk anymore!"

But I am ALREADY walking!

I cannot just STOP!

So now I am overanalyzing every single step.

Are my arms swinging too much? Not enough?

Am I walking too fast? Too slow?

Why does my LEFT foot feel WEIRD?

I have been using these legs for YEARS,

But now, in front of ONE person, I forgot the ENTIRE MANUAL.

I am just out here GLITCHING.

Trying to act natural but looking like I need a SOFTWARE UPDATE.

The second they are gone?

Back to normal. Walking fine. Zero errors.

Apparently I can ONLY function without an audience.

Comment if you malfunction in public too.
