# SCRIPT 2 - VARIATION 2

## SCRIPT
WHY does my phone decide to MALFUNCTION only when someone is looking at it?

I pull up a video to show my friend.

"Dude, you HAVE to see this."

I press play.

Nothing.

The screen is FROZEN.

I press it again. Still nothing.

Now I am panic-tapping like it is going to help.

My friend is just standing there like,

"Is this the video?"

NO! This is my phone DYING for no reason!

I exit the app. Reopen it. STILL broken.

"Forget it, never mind."

Two minutes later, I am alone, and I try again.

Works PERFECTLY.

No lag. No freezing. No issues.

My phone just wanted to make me look STUPID.

Mission accomplished, phone. Mission accomplished.

Comment if your phone has trust issues.
