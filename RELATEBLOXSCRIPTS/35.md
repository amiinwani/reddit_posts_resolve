# SCRIPT 12 - VARIATION 2

## SCRIPT
WHY does my name get LOUDER each time my parents say it?

Call one: Quiet. Chill. No urgency.

Call two: Louder. Slightly annoyed.

Call three: FULL VOLUME. EMERGENCY MODE.

They go from zero to ONE HUNDRED in three calls.

And I am just sitting there like, "I did not hear the first two!"

But they think I am IGNORING them.

I am NOT! I was just in another ROOM!

With the door CLOSED! And music PLAYING!

How was I supposed to HEAR you?

But by the time I respond, they are already at MAXIMUM ANGER.

"I have been calling you for FIVE MINUTES!"

It has been THIRTY SECONDS!

You called me THREE TIMES!

That is not five minutes! That is not even ONE MINUTE!

But they do not care about FACTS.

They care about the fact that THEY had to raise their voice.

And somehow, that is MY fault.

I did not ASK you to yell!

You could have sent a TEXT!

But no. Yelling was the move.

Comment if your parents think thirty seconds is five minutes.
