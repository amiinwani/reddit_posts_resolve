# SCRIPT 13 - VARIATION 2

## SCRIPT
WHY is my entrance SMOOTH but my exit a DISASTER?

Entering: Confident. Cool. Collected.

Exiting: CHAOS. Pure CHAOS.

I walk into a building.

Perfect posture. Good vibes.

I look like I have been here BEFORE.

Like I BELONG.

Then it is time to leave.

And I turn into a COMPLETELY different person.

I cannot find the door.

I am walking in CIRCLES.

People are STARING.

I finally find the exit.

I go to push it. It is a PULL door.

I pull it. Now it is a PUSH door.

MAKE UP YOUR MIND!

I eventually get out, but I STUMBLED on the way.

Almost FACE-PLANTED on the sidewalk.

Recovered. Barely.

I look back. Someone SAW that.

They are trying not to LAUGH.

I speed-walk away.

My entrance was FLAWLESS.

My exit was a BLOOPER REEL.

Why do I lose all COORDINATION when leaving?

Comment if your exits are also BLOOPERS.
