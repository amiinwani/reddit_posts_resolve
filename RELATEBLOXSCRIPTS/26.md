# SCRIPT 9 - VARIATION 2

## SCRIPT
WHY does sitting for ONE SECOND turn me into a completely DIFFERENT PERSON?

Standing: Energetic. Focused. Let's get things DONE.

Sitting: My goals? Never heard of them.

I was about to be SO productive.

I had PLANS. I had ENERGY.

Then I sat down to "rest for a minute."

And my entire PERSONALITY changed.

Motivation? DELETED.

Ambition? GONE.

Work ethic? Never met her.

Now I am just a person who SITS.

That is my identity now.

I am not getting up. I am not doing anything.

I am just... EXISTING in this chair.

My brain is BLANK. No thoughts. Just vibes.

And the worst part?

I am COMFORTABLE.

If I stand up now, I will have to START OVER.

Build up the motivation AGAIN.

And honestly? That sounds exhausting.

So I will just stay here. Forever.

This is my life now.

Comment if one minute of sitting destroyed you too.
