# SCRIPT 4 - VARIATION 1

## SCRIPT
WHY does my phone decide to LAG the exact moment someone is watching my screen?

I am using my phone. Everything is SMOOTH.

Apps open fast. Scrolling is perfect.

Then my friend looks over my shoulder,

"What are you doing?"

And my phone HEARS that.

It hears that someone is WATCHING.

And it goes into SLOW MOTION MODE.

I try to open an app. Loading.

I try to scroll. FREEZES.

I tap the screen. Nothing happens.

I look like I am using a phone from the STONE AGE.

"Is your phone okay?"

NO! My phone is SABOTAGING me!

It was working fine TWO SECONDS AGO!

But now, with an AUDIENCE, it is putting on a PERFORMANCE.

A performance of being the WORST phone ever made.

They walk away, and BOOM. Works perfectly.

My phone is a DRAMA QUEEN.

Comment if your phone is also dramatic.
