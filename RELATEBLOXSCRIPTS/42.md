# SCRIPT 14 - VARIATION 3

## SCRIPT
WHY does SILENCE make every sound I make TEN TIMES LOUDER?

The room is quiet. Test day. Everyone is focused.

I am sitting PERFECTLY still.

Not moving. Not breathing.

Then I need to scratch my NOSE.

I move my hand.

My sleeve SWISHES.

It sounds like I am wearing a TRASH BAG.

Everyone HEARD that.

I can FEEL their judgment.

I scratch my nose. Quick. Quiet.

My nail hits my FACE.

It sounds like I SLAPPED myself.

HOW?

I drop my eraser.

It hits the floor.

The sound ECHOES.

Like I dropped a BOWLING BALL.

It is a tiny ERASER!

But it sounded like I knocked over a CHAIR.

I lean down to pick it up.

My knee CRACKS.

LOUD. Like a GUNSHOT.

I am TWENTY YEARS OLD! Why do my joints sound like THAT?

The quiet room is making me sound like a WALKING DISASTER.

I am not even TRYING to be loud!

But somehow, I am the LOUDEST person here.

Comment if you are also the loudest person in silent rooms.
