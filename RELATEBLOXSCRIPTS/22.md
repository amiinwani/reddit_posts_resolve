## SCRIPT
WHY does my stomach make the LOUDEST noises only in silent rooms?

I am in class. Dead silent.

Everyone is taking a test.

You could hear a PIN DROP.

And my stomach goes,

"This seems like a good time to SCREAM."

GRRRRRRRRR.

EVERYONE heard that.

I KNOW they did.

I try to act normal. Like that was not me.

Maybe they think it was someone else.

But my stomach is not DONE.

It makes ANOTHER noise.

Louder this time.

A full ROAR.

Like there is a WILD ANIMAL living inside me.

I have not even been hungry!

I ate lunch TWO HOURS AGO!

But my stomach does not care about FACTS.

It just wants ATTENTION.

And it got it.

Now everyone knows I am the stomach noise person.

Great. Love that for me.

Comment if your stomach betrays you in silent rooms.
