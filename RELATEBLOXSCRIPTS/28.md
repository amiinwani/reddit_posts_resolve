# SCRIPT 10 - VARIATION 1

## SCRIPT
WHY do I become HYPER-AWARE of every single thing I do the moment I step outside?

At home: Normal. Relaxed. Just existing.

In public: EVERY MOVE IS CALCULATED.

I am walking down the street.

And suddenly I am thinking,

"Am I walking WEIRD? Do my arms look NORMAL? Is my face OKAY?"

I have been walking my ENTIRE LIFE,

But now I am questioning my TECHNIQUE.

I am breathing normal, right?

Wait. Now I am thinking about BREATHING.

And when you think about breathing, it becomes MANUAL.

Great. Now I forgot how to BREATHE automatically.

I am out here manually INHALING and EXHALING like some kind of BROKEN ROBOT.

Do people notice? Are they STARING?

I glance around. Nobody is even LOOKING at me.

But I FEEL like they are.

I feel like I am under a SPOTLIGHT.

Being JUDGED for simply EXISTING in public.

The second I get home? Back to normal.

No thoughts. Just vibes.

Comment if you overthink everything in public too.
