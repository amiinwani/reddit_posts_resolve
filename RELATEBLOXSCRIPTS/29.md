# SCRIPT 10 - VARIATION 2

## SCRIPT
WHY does leaving my house turn me into a SELF-CONSCIOUS MESS?

In my room: Confident. Carefree. Living my best life.

Outside: PANICKING about everything.

I am at the store.

Just walking. Minding my business.

Then my brain goes,

"Everyone is WATCHING you."

Are they though?

I look around. Nobody cares.

But I FEEL like I am being OBSERVED.

Like I am on a REALITY SHOW and I did not sign up for it.

Now I am overthinking my POSTURE.

Am I standing STRAIGHT? Too straight? Not straight ENOUGH?

What do I do with my HANDS?

Why are hands so AWKWARD?

I have had hands my WHOLE LIFE, but now they feel WRONG.

I put them in my pockets. Too CASUAL.

I cross my arms. Too DEFENSIVE.

I let them hang. Like a PENGUIN.

There is NO winning here.

I just want to exist WITHOUT analyzing every movement.

But public does not let me DO that.

Comment if public makes you self-conscious too.
