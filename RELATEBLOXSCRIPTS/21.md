# SCRIPT 7 - VARIATION 3

## SCRIPT
WHY does my charger CHOOSE when it wants to work?

High battery: Charger works. No complaints.

Low battery: Charger goes on VACATION.

I am at THREE PERCENT.

I plug in my charger.

The little lightning bolt does not show up.

I try again. Nothing.

Is my charger BROKEN? Or is it just EVIL?

I think it is evil.

Because sometimes it WORKS. Sometimes it DOES NOT.

There is no PATTERN. No LOGIC.

It is just vibes.

My charger wakes up and decides,

"Am I going to charge today? Hmm... NO."

And I am left there, PANICKING, watching my phone die.

I am rotating the cable like I am defusing a BOMB.

Left. Right. Upside down.

FINALLY it clicks.

Charging.

But I know the TRUTH.

My charger is not broken. It is just SELECTIVE.

It only works when IT wants to.

I am not in control here. My CHARGER is.

Comment if your charger is the BOSS of you.
