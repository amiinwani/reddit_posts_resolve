# SCRIPT 14 - VARIATION 2

## SCRIPT
WHY is everything SILENT until I need to be QUIET?

Nobody is moving. The room is DEAD SILENT.

I am taking a test. I need to focus.

I shift my weight.

My chair SCREAMS.

EVERYONE turns around.

I mouth "sorry" to NO ONE in particular.

The room goes back to quiet.

I need to turn the page of my test.

I try to do it QUIETLY.

The paper sounds like I am RIPPING IT IN HALF.

CRINKLE. CRUNCH. CRACKLE.

It is ONE PAGE!

Why does it sound like I am SHREDDING documents?

I finally get the page turned.

Now I need to write.

I put my pencil on the paper.

It SCRAPES.

Like nails on a CHALKBOARD.

I lift it up. I try again. Softer.

Still LOUD.

There is NO winning here.

Every single thing I do makes NOISE.

But when the room is LOUD? I am silent.

EXPLAIN THAT.

The universe just wants me to SUFFER.

Comment if the universe also wants you to suffer.
