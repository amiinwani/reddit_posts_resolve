# SCRIPT 2 - VARIATION 3

## SCRIPT
WHY does technology HATE me the moment I have an audience?

My phone runs like a DREAM.

Apps open instantly. Videos load fast. Everything is smooth.

Then I go to show someone ANYTHING,

And my phone transforms into a BRICK.

The loading circle appears.

Just spinning.

Mocking me.

I am sitting there like,

"I promise this is normally faster."

But they do not believe me.

They think I am using DIAL-UP.

I can see it in their eyes.

They think I am lying about how fast my phone is.

And my phone is just SITTING there, frozen, proving them RIGHT.

The SECOND they walk away?

Works fine. Zero issues.

My phone is a PAID ACTOR working against me.

Comment what your phone ruined for you.
