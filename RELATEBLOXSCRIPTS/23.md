# SCRIPT 8 - VARIATION 2

## SCRIPT
WHY is my stomach SILENT all day until the room goes QUIET?

I am talking. Laughing. Making noise.

My stomach: Nothing. Complete silence.

Then I walk into a library.

SILENT.

And my stomach WAKES UP.

It is like it was WAITING for this exact moment.

GRRRRRRRRRRRRRR.

The noise ECHOES.

People LOOK at me.

I pretend I did not hear it.

Maybe if I do not acknowledge it, it will go AWAY.

But my stomach has other plans.

It makes ANOTHER sound.

This one is LONGER. LOUDER.

It sounds like I have not eaten in WEEKS.

I ate breakfast! I ate LUNCH!

I am not even HUNGRY!

But my stomach is out here making me sound STARVED.

I am getting LOOKS.

Judgment. Pity. Confusion.

All because my stomach cannot read the ROOM.

Comment if your stomach has the worst timing.
