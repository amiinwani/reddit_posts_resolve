# SCRIPT 13 - VARIATION 1

## SCRIPT
WHY do I walk INTO a place looking confident but walk OUT looking like a MESS?

Walking in: Head high. Shoulders back. I GOT THIS.

Walking out: Defeated. Slouched. What just HAPPENED?

I walk into the store CONFIDENT.

I know what I need. I have a plan.

I look like I belong here.

Then I leave.

And suddenly I forgot how to WALK.

My arms are SWINGING weird.

My legs feel TOO LONG.

I am walking like a NEWBORN GIRAFFE.

What CHANGED?

I had confidence TEN MINUTES AGO!

But now, leaving, I feel like everyone is WATCHING me exit.

And I am FUMBLING.

Tripping over nothing.

Almost dropping my bag.

I push a door that says PULL.

CLASSIC.

I finally make it outside and I am like,

"Why did leaving feel HARDER than entering?"

Entering is EASY. You are ARRIVING.

Leaving? You are being JUDGED on your EXIT.

And I FAILED the exit.

Comment if you also fail your exits.
