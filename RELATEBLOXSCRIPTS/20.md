# SCRIPT 7 - VARIATION 2

## SCRIPT
WHY does my charger have PERFECT performance until it is CRITICAL?

Phone at ninety percent: Charger is a HERO. Lightning fast.

Phone at TWO percent: Charger becomes USELESS.

I plug it in. The charging icon does not even APPEAR.

My charger is just like, "Good luck."

I flip the cord. Still nothing.

I try a different outlet. NOTHING.

I blow on the charging port like it is a Nintendo cartridge.

STILL NOTHING.

Now I am in CRISIS MODE.

My phone is about to DIE, and my charger is on STRIKE.

Then, randomly, it decides to work.

No explanation. It just... connects.

I did not do anything DIFFERENT.

It just felt like working FINALLY.

But I cannot move my phone now.

If I move it even ONE INCH, it stops charging.

So I am stuck. FROZEN. Holding my phone in place.

This is my life now.

Comment if your charger holds you HOSTAGE.
