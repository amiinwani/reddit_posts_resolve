# SCRIPT 12 - VARIATION 3

## SCRIPT
WHY do parents have a VOLUME SCALE for saying my name?

Level one: Inside voice. Reasonable.

Level two: Slightly raised. Getting impatient.

Level three: SCREAMING. DEFCON ONE.

There is NO in-between.

It is either whisper or MEGAPHONE.

I am in my room, doing homework.

I hear a faint "hey" from downstairs.

I do not respond because I BARELY heard it.

Then I hear it again. Louder. "HEY."

I am about to respond, but before I can,

Level three ACTIVATES.

"HEYYYYYYYY!"

The entire HOUSE shakes.

The WINDOWS rattle.

I sprint downstairs like there is an EMERGENCY.

"WHAT? WHAT HAPPENED?"

And they look at me, calm as ever, and say,

"Can you take out the trash?"

ARE YOU SERIOUS?

You just SUMMONED me like the house was on FIRE,

And it is about the TRASH?

I thought someone was DYING!

But no. Just trash. Casual trash.

Comment if your parents SUMMON you for minor things.
