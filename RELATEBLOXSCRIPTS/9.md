# SCRIPT 3 - VARIATION 3

## SCRIPT
WHY do I suddenly become SELF-AWARE of walking when someone is near me?

I am walking. Completely normal. No thoughts.

Then someone appears in my VISION.

And my brain ACTIVATES.

"ALERT: We are being PERCEIVED. Initiate manual walking mode."

NO! I do not WANT manual mode!

Auto-pilot was working FINE!

But it is too late.

Now I am manually controlling each step like I am playing a VIDEO GAME.

Press W to move forward.

But I am pressing it WRONG.

My legs feel like they do not BELONG to me.

I am walking stiff like a VIDEO GAME CHARACTER with bad animation.

People are going to think I have never WALKED before.

I have been walking since I was ONE YEAR OLD,

But under OBSERVATION? I am a complete AMATEUR.

The moment I am alone again, auto-pilot RETURNS.

Smooth. Natural. Easy.

My brain cannot handle SPECTATORS.

Comment if your brain has a spectator mode.
