# SCRIPT 6 - VARIATION 1

## SCRIPT
WHY is everything CALM and RELAXED until it is my turn?

Everyone else is going. Smooth. No issues.

They are confident. They are thriving.

Then it is MY TURN.

And the UNIVERSE shifts.

Suddenly everything feels HEAVIER.

The air gets THICKER.

Time SLOWS DOWN.

All eyes are on ME.

And I can FEEL it.

My heart is RACING. My palms are SWEATING.

Two seconds ago, I was FINE.

I was ready. I knew what to say.

But NOW? My brain is a BLANK PAGE.

Empty. GONE. Nothing there.

I open my mouth to speak,

And what comes out?

"Uh..."

GREAT. Very articulate.

Everyone else made it look EASY.

But me? I am out here STRUGGLING.

The second it is over and I sit down?

Calm again. Heart rate normal.

WHY could I not feel like THIS when it was my turn?

Comment if the universe hates you too.
