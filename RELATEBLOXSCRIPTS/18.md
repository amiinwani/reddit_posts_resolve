# SCRIPT 6 - VARIATION 3

## SCRIPT
WHY am I completely FINE until the spotlight is on ME?

Waiting my turn: Relaxed. Breathing normal. Ready.

My turn arrives: PANIC MODE ACTIVATED.

What just HAPPENED?

One second ago, I was CONFIDENT.

Now I am questioning EVERYTHING.

Do I even know how to SPEAK?

What are WORDS?

How do SENTENCES work?

I have been talking my ENTIRE LIFE,

But now, in front of people, I forgot the BASICS.

My mind is RACING but also COMPLETELY EMPTY at the same time.

How is that even POSSIBLE?

I am having a full CRISIS while trying to look NORMAL.

Spoiler: I do not look normal.

I look like someone who has never been in PUBLIC before.

Then it ENDS. I sit down.

And I am FINE again.

Breathing normal. Thoughts clear.

My body just needed to make that as HORRIBLE as possible for no reason.

Comment if your body sabotages you for fun.
