## SCRIPT
WHY does my brain store the PERFECT comeback three hours too late?

I am in an argument.

My brain is EMPTY.

I sound like a broken NPC.

"Uh... well... you are... wrong."

GREAT comeback.

Really showed them.

But then, three hours later, I am eating cereal, and my brain goes,

"You should have said THIS."

Oh, NOW you show up?

Where were you when I NEEDED you?

You were BUFFERING!

And now I am sitting here, having full conversations with MYSELF.

Winning arguments that already ENDED.

My brain has the WORST timing.

Comment what comeback your brain gave you too late.
