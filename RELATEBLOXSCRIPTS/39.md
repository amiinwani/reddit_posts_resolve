# SCRIPT 13 - VARIATION 3

## SCRIPT
WHY do I enter like a MAIN CHARACTER but leave like a BACKGROUND EXTRA?

Walking in: Protagonist energy. I am THE ONE.

Walking out: Extra number seven. Forgettable.

I walk into class.

Confident stride. Good posture.

I OWN this room.

Everyone should be INTIMIDATED.

Class ends. Time to leave.

And I FORGET how to be a person.

I trip over my OWN FEET.

I drop my pencil. It ROLLS across the floor.

I go to pick it up. I hit my HEAD on the desk.

Everyone is WATCHING this disaster unfold.

I grab my stuff. I am ready to leave.

I walk to the door.

I pull. It is LOCKED.

It is not locked. It is a PUSH DOOR.

I KNEW that. I have used this door a HUNDRED TIMES.

But my brain FORGOT.

I push it. FINALLY. Freedom.

I walk out like I just SURVIVED something.

Which I did. I survived my OWN exit.

Why is leaving so HARD?

Comment if you are also the main character ONLY when entering.
