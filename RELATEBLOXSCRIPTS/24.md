# SCRIPT 8 - VARIATION 3

## SCRIPT
WHY does my stomach wait for MAXIMUM SILENCE to start making SOUNDS?

Loud room: Stomach is ASLEEP. Not a sound.

Silent room: Stomach transforms into a SPEAKER SYSTEM.

I am sitting in a quiet classroom.

Test day. Everyone is focused.

You could hear someone BREATHE.

And my stomach decides THIS is the perfect moment to PERFORM.

GRRRRRRRRRRRRR.

A deep, LOW rumble that VIBRATES through the entire room.

I freeze.

Did anyone hear that?

Yes. Yes they did.

I can feel their STARES.

My stomach does not stop there.

Oh no. It is just getting STARTED.

Another growl. Then another.

It is like a CONCERT. A symphony of EMBARRASSMENT.

I did not ask for this! I did not AUDITION for this!

But my stomach put me on STAGE anyway.

Now I am the main character in the WORST way possible.

Comment what your stomach ruined for you.
