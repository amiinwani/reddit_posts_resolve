## SCRIPT
WHY does my phone battery drop FASTER when it is below twenty percent?

My phone is at fifty percent. Battery drains SLOWLY.

Everything is fine. Taking its time.

Then I hit TWENTY PERCENT.

And my phone enters SPEEDRUN MODE.

Nineteen percent. Eighteen. Seventeen.

I AM WATCHING IT DROP IN REAL TIME.

I was not even USING my phone!

It was just SITTING there!

But apparently being below twenty percent activates TURBO DRAIN.

My phone is like, "Oh, you need me? Let me DIE FASTER."

Sixteen. Fifteen. Fourteen.

SLOW DOWN!

I plug in my charger.

Ten percent.

HOW?

It was nineteen percent TWO MINUTES AGO!

My phone saw that red battery icon and said,

"This is my TIME TO SHINE. Let's PANIC the user."

Mission accomplished. I am PANICKING.

Now I am sprinting to find an outlet before my phone DIES.

Comment if your phone also SPEEDRUNS death.
