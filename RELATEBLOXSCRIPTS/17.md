# SCRIPT 6 - VARIATION 2

## SCRIPT
WHY does the PRESSURE only exist when it is MY TURN?

I am watching everyone go before me.

They are doing FINE. No stress. No panic.

I am thinking, "This looks easy. I can do this."

Then my name gets called.

And EVERYTHING changes.

My confidence? GONE.

My preparation? VANISHED.

My ability to think? LEFT THE BUILDING.

I stand up, and I can feel EVERYONE staring at me.

The room is SILENT.

TOO silent.

Why is it so QUIET?

I forgot what I was supposed to say.

I had a PLAN. I rehearsed this!

But now my brain is playing a ERROR MESSAGE on loop.

"File not found. Please try again later."

I stumble through it. Barely survive.

Then I sit back down, and I remember EVERYTHING.

Oh, NOW my brain works. PERFECT TIMING.

Comment if your brain abandons you at the worst times.
