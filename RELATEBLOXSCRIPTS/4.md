# SCRIPT 2 - VARIATION 1

## SCRIPT
WHY does my phone turn into a POTATO the second I try to show someone something?

It works PERFECT when I am alone.

Smooth. Fast. Zero problems.

But the MOMENT someone is watching,

My phone FREEZES.

I am sitting there tapping the screen like,

"I swear it works normally."

They are just STARING at me.

I can FEEL their judgment.

And my phone is just spinning.

Loading.

Buffering.

Making me look like I am using a phone from 1843.

"Just... give it a second."

It has been TWENTY seconds!

When they leave, my phone works INSTANTLY.

Like it was FAKING the whole time.

My phone has performance anxiety.

Comment if your phone betrays you too.
