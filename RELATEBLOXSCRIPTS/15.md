# SCRIPT 5 - VARIATION 3

## SCRIPT
WHY does my bed UPGRADE itself the second I need to wake up?

At night: Basic bed. Four out of ten. Could be better.

Morning alarm: ELEVEN OUT OF TEN. MASTERPIECE. PERFECTION.

I am CONVINCED my bed has a TIMER.

It KNOWS when my alarm is about to go off,

And it activates MAXIMUM COMFORT MODE.

The temperature? PERFECT.

The blanket weight? IDEAL.

The pillow fluffiness? CHEF'S KISS.

Everything is OPTIMIZED for me to NEVER LEAVE.

This is a TRAP. My bed is SABOTAGING my life.

I have responsibilities! I have PLACES TO BE!

But my bed says, "No you do not. Stay here. FOREVER."

And honestly? Tempting.

Very tempting.

I hit snooze four times before I finally escape.

And even THEN, I am thinking about my bed all day.

That bed has a HOLD on me.

Comment if your bed is also a trap.
