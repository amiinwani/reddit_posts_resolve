# SCRIPT 9 - VARIATION 3

## SCRIPT
WHY does ONE MINUTE of sitting ERASE everything I was about to do?

I have tasks. Responsibilities. Things I NEED to accomplish.

I am walking around. Brain is ACTIVE.

"Okay, I am going to do this, then this, then this."

Perfect. Good plan.

Then I sit down.

Just to THINK for a second.

And my brain SHUTS OFF.

All those plans? GONE.

I forgot what I was even doing.

I was SO ready to be productive.

But the MOMENT I sat down, it ALL disappeared.

Now I am just sitting here like,

"What was I doing? Why am I here?"

I have NO IDEA.

My brain filed it under "Not Important" and moved on.

I try to remember. Nothing.

BLANK. Complete EMPTINESS.

Standing up does not help.

The motivation is DEAD. It is not coming back.

Sitting for one minute KILLED my entire day.

Comment if sitting deletes your brain too.
