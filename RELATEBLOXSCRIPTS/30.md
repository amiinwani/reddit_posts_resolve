# SCRIPT 10 - VARIATION 3

## SCRIPT
WHY does being in PUBLIC make me AWARE of things I never think about at home?

Home: I do not think about ANYTHING. Autopilot mode.

Public: MANUAL CONTROL of EVERYTHING.

I am walking through a mall.

And I start noticing things.

"Am I BLINKING too much? Not enough?"

I have been blinking my ENTIRE LIFE without issue,

But NOW I am thinking about it.

And when you THINK about blinking, it becomes WEIRD.

Do I blink BEFORE I finish a sentence? AFTER?

DURING?

There is no NATURAL TIMING anymore.

Everything is FORCED.

Then I start thinking about my FACE.

What EXPRESSION am I making?

Am I smiling? Should I smile?

If I smile at NOTHING, people will think I am CRAZY.

If I do not smile, I look ANGRY.

There is no NEUTRAL FACE. It does not EXIST.

I am just out here trying to look NORMAL,

But I have forgotten what NORMAL is.

The moment I get home, autopilot RETURNS. Easy.

Why can I only function in PRIVATE?

Comment if public makes you MANUALLY OPERATE your body.
