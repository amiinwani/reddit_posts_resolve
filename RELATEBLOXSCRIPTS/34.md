# SCRIPT 12 - VARIATION 1

## SCRIPT
WHY do my parents say my name LOUDER every single time they call me?

First time: Normal volume. "Hey."

I do not hear it. I am in my room.

Second time: Louder. "HEY."

Still did not hear it. I have headphones on.

Third time: NUCLEAR. "HEYYYYY!"

Okay, NOW I heard it.

I take off my headphones and yell back, "WHAT?"

And they say, in the CALMEST voice ever,

"Can you come here for a second?"

YOU COULD HAVE SAID THAT THE FIRST TIME!

Instead, you ESCALATED like I was IGNORING you on purpose!

I did not even KNOW you were calling me!

But they do not care. They think I heard all three times.

And now they are MAD because I "made them yell."

I MADE you yell?

YOU chose to yell!

You could have just WALKED to my room!

But no, you decided to increase volume until the NEIGHBORS could hear.

Now everyone thinks I am in TROUBLE.

Comment if your parents yell your name in STAGES too.
