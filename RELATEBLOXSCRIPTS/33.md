# SCRIPT 11 - VARIATION 3

## SCRIPT
WHY does my battery KNOW when it hits twenty percent and start SPRINTING to zero?

Above twenty percent: Battery is RESPONSIBLE. Slow and steady.

Below twenty percent: Battery becomes a ROCKET.

I swear there is a SWITCH that flips at twenty percent.

My phone goes from normal drain to FREEFALL.

I blink. Eighteen percent.

I blink again. FOURTEEN.

EXCUSE ME?

What happened to SEVENTEEN? SIXTEEN? FIFTEEN?

Did my phone just SKIP those?

I look away for TWO SECONDS and I lose four percent.

That is not MATH. That is not how PERCENTAGES work.

But my phone does not care about LOGIC.

It is on a MISSION to die as fast as possible.

Twelve percent. Ten percent.

I AM SPRINTING to my room to grab a charger.

My phone is in ATTACK MODE.

And I am the TARGET.

It WANTS me to panic. It FEEDS on my fear.

The second I plug it in?

Drain slows down. Back to normal.

So it CAN behave. It just CHOOSES not to.

Comment if your phone ATTACKS you below twenty percent.
