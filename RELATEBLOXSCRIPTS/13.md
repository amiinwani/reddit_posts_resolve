WHY does my bed feel TEN TIMES BETTER the moment I have to leave it?

I go to bed at night. It is just a bed.

Nothing special. Just sheets and a pillow.

Then my alarm goes off.

And SUDDENLY, my bed transforms into a CLOUD.

The softest, most comfortable place in the UNIVERSE.

I cannot possibly leave THIS.

This is HEAVEN.

Five minutes ago, I was tossing and turning,

But NOW? I am in a LUXURY RESORT.

My blanket is a HUG. My pillow is PERFECT.

Everything about this bed is ENGINEERED for comfort.

How am I supposed to leave?

I have to go to school? Work? RESPONSIBILITIES?

But my bed is literally CALLING MY NAME.

It is saying, "Stay. Just five more minutes."

Then five minutes becomes twenty.

And now I am late.

But honestly? Worth it. That bed was UNMATCHED.

Comment if your bed holds you HOSTAGE every morning.
