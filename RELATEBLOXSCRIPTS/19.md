WHY does my charger WORK perfectly until I actually NEED it to charge my phone?

My phone is at eighty percent.

I plug it in. Works fine. Charging fast.

No issues.

Then my phone hits FIVE PERCENT.

I NEED this charger to work.

I plug it in.

Nothing.

I unplug it. Plug it back in.

Still nothing.

I adjust the angle. Wiggle the cord.

FINALLY, it connects.

"Charging."

YES!

I put my phone down.

Two minutes later, I check.

"Not charging."

ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

It DISCONNECTED itself!

I did not TOUCH it! It was just SITTING there!

But my charger decided, "Nah. Not today."

So now I am holding my phone at a SPECIFIC ANGLE,

Praying it stays connected long enough to hit ten percent.

My charger only works when I do NOT need it.

Comment if your charger is also BROKEN but not really.
