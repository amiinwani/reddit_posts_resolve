# SCRIPT 1 - VARIATION 3

## SCRIPT
WHY does my brain wait until the conversation is OVER to give me good ideas?

I am talking to someone.

They say something.

My brain: crickets.

Complete SILENCE.

I just nod and say, "True."

WOW. Award-winning response right there.

Then I walk away, and SUDDENLY my brain decides to WORK.

"Wait, you could have said—"

TOO LATE! The moment is GONE!

I already walked away! I cannot go BACK!

But my brain does not care.

It keeps replaying the conversation, giving me BETTER lines.

Like some kind of twisted DIRECTOR'S CUT.

"Here is what COULD have happened if you were not useless."

Thanks, brain. Super helpful NOW.

I am stuck with the BLOOPER REEL while my brain shows me the PERFECT TAKE.

Comment if you live in the blooper reel too.
