# SCRIPT 5 - VARIATION 2

## SCRIPT
WHY is my bed AVERAGE at night but GODLY in the morning?

I sleep in my bed for eight hours.

It is fine. Nothing crazy.

Then 6 AM hits.

And my bed becomes the BEST THING I HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED.

Softer than SILK. Warmer than a FIREPLACE.

I am wrapped in PURE COMFORT.

This is not a bed anymore. This is a SANCTUARY.

How did I not notice this LAST NIGHT?

Last night, I was just lying there, scrolling on my phone.

But THIS MORNING? I am experiencing ENLIGHTENMENT.

I have reached NIRVANA. And it is in my BED.

My alarm is going off, telling me to GET UP.

But I am having a SPIRITUAL MOMENT here!

I cannot just LEAVE!

This bed and I are BONDED now.

We have a CONNECTION.

Leaving would be a BETRAYAL.

So I hit snooze. Obviously.

Comment if your bed traps you every morning.
