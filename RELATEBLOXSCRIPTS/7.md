# SCRIPT 3 - VARIATION 1

## SCRIPT
WHY do I suddenly forget how to WALK the second people are watching me?

I am walking normally.

Everything is fine.

Then I notice someone looking at me.

And my brain goes,

"Wait. How do legs work again?"

Now I am THINKING about walking.

And that is the PROBLEM.

My arms feel weird. Do I swing them? How MUCH do I swing them?

What do I do with my FACE?

Do I look straight? Do I smile? Why is walking so COMPLICATED?

I have been walking my ENTIRE LIFE,

But now, under pressure, I forgot the FORMULA.

Left foot, right foot? Or right foot, left foot?

I am out here looking like a MALFUNCTIONING ROBOT.

Just trying to get from point A to point B without looking like I have never used LEGS before.

The moment they look away, I am FINE again.

Walking normal. Zero issues.

My body has PERFORMANCE ANXIETY.

Comment if you forget how to be human in public.
