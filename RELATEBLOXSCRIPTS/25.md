# SCRIPT 9 - VARIATION 1

## SCRIPT
WHY do I sit down for ONE MINUTE and lose ALL my motivation?

I have a to-do list. Things to accomplish.

I am MOTIVATED. I am READY.

I am going to be PRODUCTIVE today.

Then I sit down.

Just for a second. Quick break.

And my motivation DIES.

Gone. VANISHED. Deleted from existence.

I was FIRED UP two seconds ago!

What HAPPENED?

The chair has POWERS.

It sucked the energy right out of me.

Now I am just sitting here. Staring at nothing.

My brain is like, "We live here now."

NO! I have stuff to DO!

But my body says, "Too late. We are COMMITTED to sitting."

I try to stand up. I cannot.

The chair will not LET ME.

I am TRAPPED in a sitting position, watching my productivity EVAPORATE.

One minute turned into twenty.

And I have done absolutely NOTHING.

Comment if sitting ruins your life too.
