# SCRIPT 14 - VARIATION 1

## SCRIPT
WHY does a quiet room become LOUD the second I move?

The room is SILENT. Perfect. Peaceful.

I am sitting still. Not making a sound.

Then I shift in my chair.

CREAAAAK.

The loudest sound EVER.

Everyone LOOKS at me.

I freeze.

Maybe if I do not move again, they will forget.

I wait.

The room goes back to silent.

Okay. Good. Crisis averted.

I need to grab my pen.

I reach for it.

My jacket RUSTLES.

It sounds like I am UNWRAPPING A CANDY BAR.

In a SILENT EXAM ROOM.

Everyone is STARING again.

I am not even DOING anything!

I am just EXISTING!

But every movement I make is AMPLIFIED.

My pencil drops. It sounds like a BOMB.

I breathe. It sounds like a TORNADO.

I blink. Somehow that is ALSO loud.

How is BLINKING loud?

I do not know, but it IS.

The room HATES me.

It is targeting ME specifically.

Comment if quiet rooms also BETRAY you.
