## SCRIPT
WHY does my phone SENSE when it has an audience and immediately start lagging?

I swear my phone has SENSORS.

It KNOWS when someone is looking.

I am scrolling through TikTok. Smooth. Perfect.

My mom walks by.

"What are you watching?"

And my phone goes,

"Oh, we have a GUEST? Time to LAG."

The video FREEZES mid-scroll.

The app CRASHES.

My phone is just sitting there BUFFERING like it forgot how to PHONE.

I restart the app. Still broken.

"Never mind, it is not working."

She walks away.

I try again. Works INSTANTLY.

EXPLAIN THAT.

My phone was FAKING IT.

It was PRETENDING to be broken just to embarrass me.

My phone and I are in a TOXIC RELATIONSHIP.

Comment if your phone is toxic too.
