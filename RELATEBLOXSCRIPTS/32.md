# SCRIPT 11 - VARIATION 2

## SCRIPT
WHY does twenty percent battery feel like FIVE MINUTES of life left?

Eighty percent: I have ALL DAY. No worries.

Twenty percent: I have SECONDS TO LIVE.

The battery was draining NORMAL this whole time.

One percent per hour. Reasonable.

Then I hit the DANGER ZONE.

Twenty percent.

And my phone goes into SELF-DESTRUCT MODE.

Nineteen. Eighteen. Seventeen.

It is PLUMMETING.

I am not even DOING anything! Just holding my phone!

But being below twenty percent apparently ACCELERATES the process.

It is like my phone is ALLERGIC to low battery.

It wants to hit ZERO as fast as possible.

Fifteen percent. Twelve percent.

WHAT HAPPENED TO SIXTEEN?

It SKIPPED a number!

My phone is not even TRYING to survive anymore.

It has given UP.

And now I am in full CRISIS MODE trying to find a charger.

Twenty percent USED to mean something.

Now it means I have THREE MINUTES.

Comment if twenty percent is a LIE on your phone too.
