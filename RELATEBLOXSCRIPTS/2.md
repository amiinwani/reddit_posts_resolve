# SCRIPT 1 - VARIATION 2

## SCRIPT
WHY does my brain save the BEST responses for when it is too late?

Someone says something to me.

I freeze.

My brain goes on VACATION.

I just stand there like, "Yeah... okay."

That is IT. That is all I said.

No comeback. No defense. Nothing.

Just "yeah okay" like some kind of robot.

Fast forward to MIDNIGHT.

I am trying to sleep, and my brain wakes up like,

"Hey, remember that thing from earlier? Here is what you should have said."

ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

I needed that HOURS ago!

Not now! Not when I am in BED!

But no, my brain waits until the moment is DEAD to suddenly become a GENIUS.

I am out here having mental REMATCHES at 2 AM.

Comment if your brain does this to you.
