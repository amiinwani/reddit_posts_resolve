# SCRIPT 4 - VARIATION 2

## SCRIPT
WHY does my phone RUN perfectly until someone SEES the screen?

Alone: My phone is a BEAST. Lightning fast.

Someone watches: My phone becomes a POTATO.

I am texting. Smooth. No issues.

My friend says, "Who are you texting?"

And leans over to look.

My phone SENSES the extra pair of eyes,

And it SHUTS DOWN all performance.

The keyboard starts LAGGING.

Letters appear three seconds AFTER I type them.

I look like I do not know how to USE a phone.

"Why is it so slow?"

I DO NOT KNOW! ASK THE PHONE!

It was not slow BEFORE you looked!

This is TARGETED. This is PERSONAL.

My phone has stage fright.

And I am the one paying the price.

Comment if your phone has stage fright too.
