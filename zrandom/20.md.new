# TARGET QUERY: daily routine app reddit

# app for building an actual daily routine that sticks?

i have zero routine in my life and its killing my productivity. i wake up at different times, do things in random order, forget important stuff, and generally just wing it every day which leads to nothing getting done.

i want to build a consistent daily routine but every "routine app" ive tried is either:
- too rigid (wants me to schedule every minute of my day)
- just a task list (not really a routine)
- focused on morning routines only (i need help with my whole day)
- gamified in annoying ways

what i need:
- flexible routine tracking (some days i wake up at 6am, some days 8am, routine should adapt)
- ability to track both time-based stuff (morning routine) and habits (did i exercise)
- see if im actually following my routine over time
- reminders but not annoying ones
- works with my existing calendar/life

ive tried:
- fabulous - way too prescriptive, wants me to follow their exact routine
- routinery - interesting but too focused on just morning/evening
- habitica - not really for routines, more for one-off habits
- google calendar - too manual, have to schedule everything

basically i want something between a habit tracker and a calendar. track my routine, show me if im consistent, but dont make me schedule every second of my day.

anyone found something that works for building and sticking to a daily routine? or do you just use a combination of apps?
