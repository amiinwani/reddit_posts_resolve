# TARGET QUERY: focus tracking app reddit

# app that tracks actual focus time (not just time at desk)?

i sit at my desk for 8 hours a day but probably only do 2 hours of actual focused work. the rest is procrastination, distractions, and pretending to work.

i need an app that tracks ACTUAL focus time so i can:
- see how much i really work vs how much i think i work
- identify patterns in when im most/least focused
- gradually increase my focused work time
- stop lying to myself about productivity

what doesnt work:
- rescue time - tracks apps but not actual focus (i can have work apps open while scrolling reddit on phone)
- toggl - i forget to start/stop it, also i can lie about what im tracking
- pomodoro apps - i dont start the timer when im procrastinating
- calendar blocking - i block time but dont actually focus during it

what i think i need:
- timer that tracks actual focused work sessions
- analytics showing focus time over days/weeks/months
- maybe combined with habit tracking (did i do deep work today)
- hard to cheat/lie to myself
- shows patterns (im more focused in mornings, etc)

does anything like this exist? how do you track actual focus vs just time spent at desk?

especially curious what people with ADHD or focus issues use because thats me.
