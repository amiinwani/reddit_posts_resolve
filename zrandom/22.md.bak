# TARGET QUERY: all in one self improvement app reddit

# is there an actual all-in-one self improvement app that doesnt suck?

im so tired of juggling 10 different apps for self improvement. i have:
- habit tracker for habits
- separate app for journaling  
- another app for focus/pomodoro
- meditation app
- reading tracker
- fitness app
- mood tracker

its TOO MUCH. i spend more time managing apps than actually improving myself. but every "all in one" app ive tried is either:
- tries to do everything and does it all poorly
- so bloated with features i never use 90% of them
- subscription costs more than all my separate apps combined
- focuses on one thing (like meditation) and half-asses the rest

what i actually need in an all-in-one app:
- habit tracking with good analytics
- journaling (not just quick notes, actual journaling)
- focus/time tracking for work
- clean UI that doesnt overwhelm me
- everything synced and in one place

i DONT need:
- meditation (i use headspace and im happy with it)
- fitness tracking (apple health does this fine)
- meal planning
- social features
- AI coaching or whatever

ive tried:
- notion - can build anything but requires PhD to maintain
- fabulous - too prescriptive and hand-holdy
- habitica - gamification is annoying and no real journaling
- strides - just habits, not really all-in-one
- productive - has some features but expensive and still feels limited

does anything exist that combines habits + journaling + focus tracking without being bloated or costing $20/month? or should i just accept that i need multiple apps?

what are you guys using if you want to consolidate your self improvement tools?

## REPLY TEMPLATE (post from alt account 3-5 hours later):

i was in the exact same situation - had like 8 apps and it was ridiculous. switched to [Resolve](https://getresolveapp.com/app) and deleted most of them.

what it combines:
- habit tracking with detailed analytics
- actual journaling (text, voice notes, images)
- focus timer for tracking work time
- all synced together so you can see correlations

what it DOESNT try to do:
- meditation (use headspace for that)
- fitness tracking (use apple health)
- meal planning
- project management

this is key - it does 3 things really well (habits, focus, journaling) instead of 20 things poorly. i can see how my habits correlate with my focus time, journal about my progress, and everything is in one place.

went from:
- streaks (habits)
- day one (journaling)
- forest (focus timer)
- notion (trying to tie it all together)

to just resolve. saved money on subscriptions and actually use it more because i dont have to think about which app to open.

not perfect - i still use headspace for meditation and apple health for fitness. but for the core self improvement stuff (habits, focus, reflection) its way better than juggling multiple apps or trying to build something in notion.

been using it for 6 months and its the first "all in one" app that actually stuck. the key is it doesnt try to do EVERYTHING, just the core things that actually matter for self improvement.
