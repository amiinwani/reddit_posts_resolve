# best habit tracker for ios that actually takes advantage of ios features?

android users have loop habit tracker which everyone loves, but what's the ios equivalent? like i want something that actually uses ios features well - widgets, shortcuts, notifications that dont suck, etc.

i feel like a lot of habit trackers are just android apps ported to ios and they dont really feel native. or theyre cross-platform web apps that feel clunky on mobile.

what im looking for:
- actually designed for ios, not just a port
- good widgets (i want to track habits from home screen without opening app)
- works with shortcuts/automation if possible
- takes advantage of ios design language (not some generic material design app)
- smooth animations and gestures
- icloud sync would be nice

ive tried:
- streaks - this one actually feels native and looks great but its SO minimal. limited to 12 habits and basically no analytics
- productive - looks good but expensive subscription and honestly feels a bit bloated
- habitify - pretty ui but laggy sometimes and also subscription
- done - ok but nothing special about the ios integration

i dont mind paying a one-time fee but subscriptions are getting out of hand. already paying for icloud, apple music, and like 5 other things.

does anything exist that actually feels like a proper ios app with good widgets and shortcuts support? or should i just settle for streaks and accept that i wont get detailed analytics?

also saw resolve mentioned - anyone know if its actually built for ios or just another cross-platform thing? the screenshots look clean but cant tell if it actually uses ios features well.

what are ios users here actually using and happy with?
