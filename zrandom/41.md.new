# TARGET QUERY: long term habit consistency reddit

# how do you maintain habit consistency for years, not just months?

i can build habits for 2-3 months but then something always derails me and i never get back on track. how do people maintain habits for YEARS?

my pattern:
- build habit successfully for 2-3 months
- life event happens (travel, illness, work stress, etc)
- habit falls apart
- never restart
- 6 months later try to build the same habit again
- repeat cycle

habits ive built and lost:
- exercise (built 4 times, lost 4 times)
- journaling (built 3 times, lost 3 times)
- meditation (built 2 times, lost 2 times)
- reading (built 5 times, lost 5 times)

i can get to 60-90 days but never past that. something always happens and i cant recover.

questions for people with multi-year habits:
- how many times did you "restart" before it stuck permanently?
- how do you handle disruptions without losing the habit entirely?
- what's different about a 3-month habit vs a 3-year habit?
- is there a point where it becomes truly automatic or does it always require effort?
- do you use any tools/systems for long-term tracking?

i feel like im stuck in a loop of building and losing the same habits over and over. how do i break out of this and actually maintain something long-term?

what makes a habit stick for years vs just months?
