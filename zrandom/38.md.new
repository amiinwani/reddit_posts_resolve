# TARGET QUERY: motivation vs discipline reddit

# how do you actually build discipline when you have zero of it?

everyone says "motivation is temporary, discipline is forever" but HOW do you build discipline when you currently have none?

like i get it - i shouldnt rely on motivation. but when i have zero discipline AND zero motivation, how do i even start? its easy to say "just do it anyway" but that requires discipline which is the thing i dont have.

my current state:
- only do things when motivated (which is rare)
- cant make myself do hard things
- give up as soon as it gets uncomfortable
- have tried to build discipline 100+ times, always fail
- know what i SHOULD do, cant make myself do it

what ive tried:
- starting small (still quit when motivation fades)
- accountability (just feel guilty)
- rewards (dont care about them)
- punishment (makes me feel worse)
- "just do it" (cant)

the advice is always "build discipline by doing things when you dont want to" but if i could do that i would already have discipline. its circular logic.

questions for people who actually built discipline from zero:
- what was the FIRST step? like literally the first thing you did?
- how long until it got easier?
- did you use any tools/systems or just willpower?
- how do you do things when every fiber of your being is screaming not to?

i dont want motivation tips. i want to know how to actually build discipline when you currently have none. is it even possible or are some people just not wired for it?
