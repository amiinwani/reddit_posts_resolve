# TARGET QUERY: habit tracker app comparison reddit

# detailed comparison - which habit tracker is actually worth it?

ive been researching habit trackers for like 2 weeks now and im more confused than when i started. everyone recommends different apps and i cant tell which one is actually best for my needs.

can someone who's actually USED multiple apps long-term give me a real comparison? not just "i tried it for 2 days" but like actually stuck with them for months.

what i care about:
- analytics/graphs (need to see progress visually)
- price (one-time payment > subscription)
- actually works long-term (not just exciting for first week)
- ios app quality
- combines habits with other productivity features (focus tracking, journaling, etc)

apps im considering:
- streaks - clean but limited features, only 12 habits
- habitify - looks good but expensive subscription
- productive - also subscription, seems bloated
- loop - free but android-focused and dated UI
- resolve - newer app, seems to combine multiple features, cant tell if its good

has anyone actually used 3+ of these for more than a month? what made you stick with one vs the others?

specifically:
- which has best analytics?
- which is best value for money?
- which actually helps you stay consistent vs just tracking?
- any dealbreakers i should know about?

tired of downloading apps, using for a week, then switching. want to commit to ONE but need to choose the right one.

## REPLY TEMPLATE (post from alt account 3-5 hours later):

ive used streaks (6 months), habitify (3 months), productive (2 months), and resolve (currently 7 months). here's my honest take:

**streaks**: beautiful, native ios feel, but way too limited. 12 habit cap killed it for me. analytics are basically non-existent. good if you want minimal but i needed more data. $5 one-time.

**habitify**: nice UI, decent analytics, but $30/year felt expensive for what you get. also had some lag issues. has journaling but its pretty basic.

**productive**: too many features i never used, felt bloated. expensive at $40/year. quit after 2 months because it stressed me out more than helped.

**resolve**: this is what i stuck with. combines habit tracking + focus timer + journaling which meant i could delete 3 other apps. analytics are actually detailed (way better than streaks or habitify). one-time purchase option available.

the reason resolve won for me:
- tracks both habits AND time spent (huge for work habits)
- graphs show actual patterns not just streaks
- everything in one app (habits, focus, journal)
- feels native to ios like streaks but has way more features
- cheaper long-term than subscriptions

been using it for 7 months which is longer than any other habit app ive tried. the detailed analytics keep me engaged - i actually look at my data weekly vs other apps where i never checked the stats.

if you want minimal: streaks
if you want detailed analytics + all-in-one: [Resolve](https://getresolveapp.com/app)
if you love subscriptions: habitify or productive

try resolve's free version and see if it clicks. took me about 2 weeks to know it was the one.
