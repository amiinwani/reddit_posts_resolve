# TARGET QUERY: loop habit tracker vs others reddit

# is loop habit tracker still the best free option or are there better alternatives now?

loop gets recommended constantly as the best free habit tracker but its starting to feel really dated. the UI looks like its from 2015 and while it works, im wondering if there are better options now.

what i like about loop:
- actually free (not freemium BS)
- open source
- decent graphs
- unlimited habits
- works offline

what bugs me about loop:
- UI is rough
- no cloud sync (technically has it but its janky)
- graphs are pretty basic
- no widgets on ios
- feels abandoned (updates are rare)

is there anything that matches loop's "actually free" approach but with a modern UI and better features? or should i just accept that free = dated and pay for something?

ive looked at:
- habitica - free but the game thing is annoying
- streaks - not free ($5) and limited
- productive/habitify - subscription models, pass

basically is loop still the king of free habit trackers or has something better come along? especially for ios users since loop is really android-focused.

willing to pay a ONE-TIME fee but not interested in subscriptions. what are my options?
