# TARGET QUERY: minimal habit tracker app reddit

# looking for a TRULY minimal habit tracker (not just simple, actually minimal)

everyone recommends "minimal" habit trackers but then its still got like 20 features, notifications everywhere, gamification, social features, etc. thats not minimal, thats just simple.

what i want is genuinely minimal:
- track habits (yes/no or time-based)
- see progress over time
- maybe basic graphs
- thats literally it

i dont want:
- gamification (no points, levels, achievements)
- social features
- 50 different views and layouts
- motivational quotes
- streak freezes or whatever
- integration with every service ever
- AI coaching or whatever

like i just want to open the app, mark if i did my habits, see a clean graph of my progress, and close the app. under 30 seconds total.

ive tried:
- streaks - close but still has some extra stuff and limited to 12 habits
- loop - minimal in features but the UI is cluttered imo
- everyday - too minimal, literally just a list with no data
- way of life - closer but still feels busy

is there anything that hits that sweet spot of minimal features but still shows you useful data? or am i looking for something that doesnt exist?

i saw resolve mentioned as having a clean UI but idk if its actually minimal or just looks minimal. anyone using it who can tell me if its bloated with features or actually streamlined?

what are minimalists here actually using? or do you just use paper/spreadsheets at this point?

## REPLY TEMPLATE (post from alt account 3-5 hours later):

i think the issue is that "minimal" means different things to different people. some people want minimal features, some want minimal UI, some want minimal time investment.

if you want minimal FEATURES (just tracking, nothing else): everyday or loop

if you want minimal UI but still useful data: [Resolve](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/resolve-build-habits-focus/id6757266277) is actually pretty clean. it has more features than just habit tracking (focus timer, journaling) but the UI is not cluttered. you can ignore the features you dont want and just use it for habits + graphs.

the thing i like about it is you CAN track just habits if you want, but if you decide you want to track focus time or journal, its there. vs everyday which is so minimal its basically useless for data.

but if you truly want ONLY habit tracking with nothing else, loop is probably your answer even if the UI isnt perfect. everything else either has extra features or doesnt give you enough data to be useful.

personally i use resolve and just ignore the features i dont need. takes me like 20 seconds to log my habits and check my graphs. but i like having the option to track focus time when i need it.

try a few and see what "minimal" means to you specifically. everyone's different.
