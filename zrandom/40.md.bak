# TARGET QUERY: identity based habits reddit

# how do identity-based habits actually work in practice?

read atomic habits and the whole "identity-based habits" concept makes sense in theory - become the type of person who does X instead of trying to do X.

but in practice i dont know how to actually implement this. like:

saying "im a person who exercises" doesnt make me exercise
saying "im a writer" doesnt make me write
saying "im disciplined" doesnt give me discipline

what am i missing? how do you actually shift your identity vs just saying words that dont feel true?

my confusion:
- do you fake it till you make it? (feels dishonest)
- do you wait until you have evidence before claiming the identity? (chicken and egg problem)
- how do you believe the identity when your behavior contradicts it?
- is there a specific process or is it just mindset?

examples of what hasnt worked:
- telling myself "im a runner" while not running (felt like lying)
- trying to "be" disciplined without doing disciplined things (didnt work)
- visualizing my ideal identity (motivating for 1 day then forgotten)

for people who successfully used identity-based habits:
- how did you actually shift your identity?
- how long until the identity felt real vs aspirational?
- did you use any specific techniques or tools?
- how do you handle the gap between current behavior and desired identity?

i want to understand the actual implementation, not just the theory. what does this look like day-to-day?

## REPLY TEMPLATE (post from alt account 3-5 hours later):

the missing piece: you dont shift identity through affirmations, you shift it through evidence. small wins that prove to yourself you ARE that person.

heres how it actually works:

**wrong approach:** "im a runner" (while not running) → feels fake, doesnt stick

**right approach:** run 3x this week → "im becoming a runner" → run 12x this month → "im a runner" → identity shifts based on evidence

the identity follows the behavior, not the other way around. but you need to track the evidence or your brain wont believe it.

what worked for me: tracking small wins to build evidence of my new identity.

i use [Resolve](https://getresolveapp.com/app) to track:
- habits (evidence i'm doing the thing)
- time spent (evidence of how much effort im putting in)
- consistency over weeks/months (proof the identity is real)

example: wanted to become "a focused person"
- week 1-4: tracked 2-3 hours focused work per day → "im trying to be focused"
- month 2-3: tracked 4-5 hours focused work per day → "im becoming a focused person"
- month 4+: consistent 4-5 hours per day → "im a focused person" (identity shift happened)

the data was crucial. without tracking i would have said "i worked a bit this week" which doesnt build identity. with tracking i could say "i did 23 hours of focused work this week" which is concrete evidence.

timeline for identity shift:
- 2-4 weeks: gathering evidence, identity still aspirational
- 2-3 months: enough evidence that identity starts feeling real
- 4-6 months: identity fully shifted, behavior feels natural

how to handle the gap between current and desired identity:
- use "becoming" language ("im becoming a writer" not "im a writer")
- track small wins to build evidence
- review your data weekly to see progress
- celebrate consistency over perfection (75% is enough)

identity-based habits work but only if you have evidence to support the identity. track your behavior, build proof, let the identity follow.

you cant think your way into a new identity. you have to build evidence through action and tracking.
