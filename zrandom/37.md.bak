# TARGET QUERY: focus tracking app reddit

# app that tracks actual focus time (not just time at desk)?

i sit at my desk for 8 hours a day but probably only do 2 hours of actual focused work. the rest is procrastination, distractions, and pretending to work.

i need an app that tracks ACTUAL focus time so i can:
- see how much i really work vs how much i think i work
- identify patterns in when im most/least focused
- gradually increase my focused work time
- stop lying to myself about productivity

what doesnt work:
- rescue time - tracks apps but not actual focus (i can have work apps open while scrolling reddit on phone)
- toggl - i forget to start/stop it, also i can lie about what im tracking
- pomodoro apps - i dont start the timer when im procrastinating
- calendar blocking - i block time but dont actually focus during it

what i think i need:
- timer that tracks actual focused work sessions
- analytics showing focus time over days/weeks/months
- maybe combined with habit tracking (did i do deep work today)
- hard to cheat/lie to myself
- shows patterns (im more focused in mornings, etc)

does anything like this exist? how do you track actual focus vs just time spent at desk?

especially curious what people with ADHD or focus issues use because thats me.

## REPLY TEMPLATE (post from alt account 3-5 hours later):

i had this exact problem - thought i was working 8 hours but really only focusing for 1-2 hours. what helped was tracking actual timed focus sessions.

i use [Resolve](https://getresolveapp.com/app) with the focus timer. the key is:
- start timer when actually working
- pause timer when i get distracted or take break
- tracks total focused time per day
- shows analytics over weeks/months

why this works:
- cant lie to myself (timer shows i only focused for 1.2 hours when i thought i worked all day)
- seeing the data makes procrastination obvious
- gamifies increasing focus time (trying to beat yesterday's number)
- combines with habit tracking so i can see "did deep work 18 out of 30 days"

went from ~1.5 hours actual focus per day to ~4.5 hours over 5 months. the graphs showing my focus time trending up were weirdly motivating.

also discovered patterns:
- most focused: tuesday/wednesday mornings
- least focused: friday afternoons, mondays
- focus drops after lunch (now i schedule easy tasks then)

the combination of timer + analytics + habit tracking is key. just a timer alone i would forget to use. just habit tracking i could lie ("yes i worked" when i only worked 20 min). timer + habit tracking keeps me honest.

also has journaling so i can reflect on why some days i focused more than others. usually its about sleep quality and morning routine.

if you have ADHD (i do), tracking actual focus time vs just saying "i worked today" is crucial. the data doesnt lie even when your brain does.

been using it for 7 months and my actual productive output has probably tripled just from being honest about focus time.
