# TARGET QUERY: habit relapse reddit

# how do you recover from a habit relapse without completely giving up?

had a 45 day streak of working out daily. then i got sick for a week, missed 7 days straight, and now its been 3 weeks and i havent worked out once. this always happens - i build momentum, something disrupts it, and i cant get back on track.

its not just exercise. same thing happened with:
- journaling (had 30 day streak, went on vacation, never restarted)
- meditation (20 days, got busy at work, quit)
- reading (15 days, one bad week, stopped entirely)

the pattern:
1. build habit successfully for weeks
2. life event disrupts it (sick, travel, work stress, etc)
3. miss several days in a row
4. feel like i "ruined" all my progress
5. cant motivate myself to restart
6. give up entirely

rationally i know missing a week doesnt erase weeks of progress. but emotionally it feels like starting from zero again and i just... dont. i stay in the relapse indefinitely.

questions:
- how do you actually restart after a relapse without it feeling like starting over?
- does anyone else struggle with this specific pattern?
- is there a way to make relapses less devastating mentally?
- should i be tracking habits differently so relapses dont feel like complete failure?

i hate that i can build a habit for 45 days and then one bad week erases all of it. how do i break this cycle?
