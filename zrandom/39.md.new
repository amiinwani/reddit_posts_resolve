# TARGET QUERY: systems over motivation reddit

# how to actually build systems instead of relying on motivation?

i understand the concept - systems beat motivation. but HOW do you build systems that actually work?

every "system" i try to build falls apart after a week because:
- i forget to follow it
- it requires too much maintenance
- it feels rigid and i rebel against it
- i get bored and stop using it

examples of systems ive tried to build:
- morning routine (followed for 5 days then stopped)
- weekly planning (did it twice then forgot)
- time blocking (ignored my own schedule)
- habit tracking (tried 10+ apps, quit all of them)
- journaling system (lasted 2 weeks)

the problem isnt understanding that systems are important. the problem is i cant seem to build systems that stick.

questions:
- what makes a system actually sustainable vs just another thing you quit?
- how simple should a system be? (mine might be too complicated)
- how do you remember to follow your system when motivation fades?
- what systems have actually worked for you long-term (6+ months)?
- do you use apps/tools or just paper/willpower?

i feel like im missing something fundamental about how to build systems that dont require constant motivation to maintain.

what systems are you using that have actually lasted? and how did you make them stick?
