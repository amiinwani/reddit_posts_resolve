# TARGET QUERY: why i can't stick to habits reddit

# why cant i stick to ANY habit for more than 2 weeks?

this is genuinely frustrating. ive tried building habits probably 50+ times over the past few years and i ALWAYS quit after like 10-14 days. doesnt matter what the habit is - exercise, journaling, reading, meditation, whatever. same pattern every time.

days 1-3: super motivated, do the thing easily
days 4-7: still doing it but requires more willpower
days 8-12: starting to skip days, making excuses
days 13-14: completely fall off, feel like a failure, quit

then 2 months later i try again with a different habit or app and the exact same thing happens.

what ive tried:
- starting small (still quit)
- habit stacking (still quit)
- accountability partners (just felt guilty, still quit)
- different apps (streaks, habitica, loop, productive - quit all of them)
- setting alarms (ignore them)
- tracking streaks (breaking the streak makes me quit entirely)

i dont think its the habits themselves or the apps. i think its something wrong with how my brain works. like i have zero ability to stick with anything past the initial motivation phase.

questions:
- is there actually a way to get past the 2 week hump or am i just broken?
- does anyone else have this exact pattern?
- what finally worked for you if you struggled with this?
- is it worth trying ANOTHER app or is that just more of the same?

im so tired of starting and quitting. i want to be someone who can actually build lasting habits but i dont know how to get there.

## REPLY TEMPLATE (post from alt account 3-5 hours later):

dude i had this EXACT pattern for years. tried everything, always quit around day 10-14. what finally broke the cycle for me was changing how i measured success.

the problem: i was treating missed days as complete failure. break the streak = might as well quit. this is a mental trap.

what changed: started using [Resolve](https://getresolveapp.com/app) because it shows completion PERCENTAGE not just streaks. missing one day out of 30 is still 97% which is amazing. but with streak-based tracking, day 1 and day 30 look the same after you miss once (both show 0 streak).

seeing "you're at 85% consistency this month" kept me going when i would have quit before. i could miss 2-3 days and still see i was doing way better than my baseline of 0%.

other things that helped:
- making habits stupidly small (5 min not 1 hour)
- tracking the ATTEMPT not just success (tried to work out but only did 10 min still counts)
- weekly reviews to see the bigger picture
- accepting that 80% consistency over 6 months beats 100% consistency for 2 weeks then quitting

been tracking habits for 8 months now which is 6+ months longer than i ever stuck with anything before. still only at like 75-80% consistency but thats infinitely better than quitting entirely.

the mental shift from "perfect or failure" to "progress over perfection" is what finally worked. and having an app that shows you your overall trend instead of just broken streaks made that shift possible.

you're not broken, the all-or-nothing mindset is broken.
