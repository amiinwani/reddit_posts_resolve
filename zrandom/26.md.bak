# TARGET QUERY: habitica vs streaks reddit

# habitica vs streaks - which one actually works better long-term?

trying to decide between these two and they're completely different approaches. habitica is all gamification and RPG elements, streaks is super minimal and clean.

**habitica:**
- pros: gamification can be motivating, free, social features
- cons: feels childish sometimes, cluttered UI, analytics are weak

**streaks:**
- pros: beautiful minimal design, native ios, clean
- cons: limited to 12 habits, no analytics really, $5 cost

my concern with habitica is that the game elements will get annoying after the novelty wears off. my concern with streaks is that its TOO minimal and wont give me enough data.

for people who've used both - which one did you stick with and why? did the gamification in habitica actually help long-term or did it get old? is streaks too limited or is minimal actually better?

also open to "neither, use X instead" recommendations if you think both of these miss the mark.

what matters to me:
- actually helps me stay consistent (not just fun for a week)
- shows me progress over time
- ios app
- not insanely expensive

## REPLY TEMPLATE (post from alt account 3-5 hours later):

tried both. habitica for 2 months, streaks for 4 months. ended up with neither.

habitica: the gamification was fun for exactly 2 weeks then it felt like a chore. having to battle monsters and manage my character was just MORE stuff to do. also the analytics are terrible - it just shows you your level and gold, not actual habit data. quit after 2 months.

streaks: loved the minimal design but the 12 habit limit killed it. also basically no analytics - just shows your streak number. i need to see patterns and trends, not just "you did this 47 days in a row". used it for 4 months then hit the limit.

what i switched to: [Resolve](https://getresolveapp.com/app)

it hits the middle ground - clean UI like streaks but with actual features. detailed analytics (way better than either habitica or streaks), unlimited habits, combines habit tracking with focus timer and journaling.

no gamification BS but also not so minimal that you get no data. you can see your progress over weeks and months, patterns in your consistency, completion percentages, etc.

been using it for 6 months which is longer than i used either habitica or streaks. the detailed graphs keep me engaged without the annoying game elements.

if you want gamification: habitica
if you want minimal: streaks
if you want actual useful features without bloat: try resolve

the free version is good enough to test if you like it.
