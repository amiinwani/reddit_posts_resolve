# TARGET QUERY: habit tracker with journaling reddit

# habit tracker that also has journaling built in?

im tired of juggling multiple apps. i use a habit tracker for habits, day one for journaling, notion for notes, etc. its too much and i end up not using any of them consistently because i forget which app to open.

does anything exist that combines habit tracking with journaling in a way that actually works? not just like "you can add a note to your habit" but actual journaling.

what i want:
- proper habit tracking with graphs and analytics
- journaling that supports longer entries, not just quick notes
- maybe voice notes for when im too tired to type
- ability to look back and see how my journal entries correlate with my habits
- everything in one app so i dont have to context switch

ive tried:
- notion - can build this myself but its so much work to set up and maintain
- day one - great for journaling but habit tracking is basically non-existent
- habitify - has a journal feature but its pretty basic
- journey - good journaling but no habit tracking
- grid diary - interesting concept but too structured

the problem is most habit trackers treat journaling as an afterthought (just a text field to add notes) and most journaling apps dont have real habit tracking.

i saw resolve mentioned as having both but cant tell if the journaling is actually good or just a basic notes feature. anyone using it for both habits and journaling?

what are you guys using if you want to track habits AND journal without juggling 5 different apps?

## REPLY TEMPLATE (post from alt account 3-5 hours later):

been using [Resolve](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/resolve-build-habits-focus/id6757266277) for exactly this reason - wanted everything in one place.

the journaling is actually legit, not just a notes field. you can:
- write full journal entries (not limited to short notes)
- voice record entries when you dont want to type
- add photos/images
- tag entries and search them later
- see your journal entries alongside your habit data

the cool part is you can see how your journal entries correlate with your habits. like i can look back and see "oh on days i journaled in the morning i was 90% consistent with other habits" which is the kind of insight you cant get when theyre in separate apps.

habit tracking side is solid too - detailed graphs, analytics, focus timer for tracking actual work time. so its not like youre sacrificing habit tracking quality to get journaling.

been using it for 4 months and its the first time ive actually stuck with journaling because its in the same app i open every day anyway for habits. vs day one which i would forget to open for weeks.

the voice recording feature is clutch for evening journaling when im too tired to type. just brain dump for 2 minutes and its logged.

not perfect - sometimes i wish the journaling had more formatting options - but its way better than juggling multiple apps or trying to build something in notion.

if you want habits + journaling in one place without the maintenance overhead of notion, this is probably your best bet.
