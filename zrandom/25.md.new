# TARGET QUERY: habit tracker vs notion reddit

# habit tracking in notion vs dedicated habit tracker app - which is better?

i love notion and use it for everything but im wondering if i should move my habit tracking to a dedicated app instead.

**pros of notion for habits:**
- everything in one place (notes, tasks, habits, etc)
- infinitely customizable
- can build exactly what i want
- already paying for it

**cons of notion for habits:**
- takes FOREVER to set up and maintain
- no widgets (have to open notion every time)
- mobile app is slow
- analytics require building complex formulas
- if i mess up my template i have to rebuild it

**pros of dedicated habit app:**
- works out of the box, no setup
- designed specifically for habits
- usually has widgets
- better mobile experience
- built-in analytics

**cons of dedicated habit app:**
- another app to manage
- another subscription potentially
- data is siloed from my other stuff in notion

my question: for people who use notion for everything, did you move habit tracking out of notion? if so, what made you switch and do you regret it?

or for people who tried dedicated apps and went back to notion, why?

im spending like 2 hours a week maintaining my notion habit tracker and im wondering if thats time i could spend actually doing the habits instead...

but i also like having everything in notion. torn on this.

what would you recommend?
