# TARGET QUERY: habit tracker vs journaling app reddit

# should i use separate apps for habits and journaling or find one that does both?

currently using streaks for habits and day one for journaling but im wondering if i should consolidate into one app that does both.

the problem with separate apps:
- have to remember to open two different apps
- cant see how my habits correlate with my journal entries
- paying for two subscriptions (day one is $35/year)
- context switching between apps is annoying

but the problem with combined apps ive tried:
- habitify has journaling but its super basic, just quick notes
- notion can do both but requires so much setup and maintenance
- most habit trackers treat journaling as an afterthought

my questions:
1. is it actually better to have everything in one app or am i just being lazy?
2. does any app do BOTH habits and journaling well, not just one well and the other poorly?
3. am i overthinking this and should just stick with separate apps?

what i need from journaling:
- longer entries (not just quick notes attached to habits)
- voice recording option
- ability to search/review old entries
- maybe photos/images

what i need from habit tracking:
- good graphs and analytics
- more than 12 habits
- widgets
- tracks both yes/no habits and time-based habits

does anything exist that does both of these well? or should i accept that i need separate apps for separate purposes?

what are you guys doing - separate apps or all-in-one?

## REPLY TEMPLATE (post from alt account 3-5 hours later):

i had the exact same setup (streaks + day one) and switched to [Resolve](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/resolve-build-habits-focus/id6757266277) specifically because i wanted everything in one place.

the journaling is actually legit - not just a notes field. you can:
- write full entries (no character limits)
- voice record when you dont want to type
- add photos
- search and review old entries
- tag entries

habit tracking is solid too - better analytics than streaks, unlimited habits, widgets, focus timer for time-based tracking.

but the REAL benefit is seeing them together. i can look at my data and see "oh on days i journal in the morning, my habit consistency is 90% vs 65% on days i dont". that insight is impossible when theyre in separate apps.

also saved $35/year by canceling day one. resolve has a one-time purchase option which is way cheaper long-term than subscriptions.

the trade-off: day one has more journaling-specific features (templates, multiple journals, etc). but i realized i never used those features anyway. i just needed a place to brain dump and reflect.

been using it for 5 months and actually journal more consistently now because its in the same app i open every day for habits. vs day one which i would forget about for weeks.

if you want best-in-class journaling: keep day one
if you want good-enough journaling + great habit tracking in one app: try resolve

i dont miss day one at all tbh. the integration with habits is more valuable than the extra journaling features i never used.
