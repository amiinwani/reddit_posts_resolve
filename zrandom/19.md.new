# TARGET QUERY: habit tracker with journaling reddit

# habit tracker that also has journaling built in?

im tired of juggling multiple apps. i use a habit tracker for habits, day one for journaling, notion for notes, etc. its too much and i end up not using any of them consistently because i forget which app to open.

does anything exist that combines habit tracking with journaling in a way that actually works? not just like "you can add a note to your habit" but actual journaling.

what i want:
- proper habit tracking with graphs and analytics
- journaling that supports longer entries, not just quick notes
- maybe voice notes for when im too tired to type
- ability to look back and see how my journal entries correlate with my habits
- everything in one app so i dont have to context switch

ive tried:
- notion - can build this myself but its so much work to set up and maintain
- day one - great for journaling but habit tracking is basically non-existent
- habitify - has a journal feature but its pretty basic
- journey - good journaling but no habit tracking
- grid diary - interesting concept but too structured

the problem is most habit trackers treat journaling as an afterthought (just a text field to add notes) and most journaling apps dont have real habit tracking.

i saw resolve mentioned as having both but cant tell if the journaling is actually good or just a basic notes feature. anyone using it for both habits and journaling?

what are you guys using if you want to track habits AND journal without juggling 5 different apps?
