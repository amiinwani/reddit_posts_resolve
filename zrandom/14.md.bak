# TARGET QUERY: best habit tracker app free reddit

# best FREE habit tracker app that actually has good features?

i dont want to pay $10-15/month for a habit tracker (already paying for too many subscriptions) but every free app i try is either super limited or has all the good features locked behind a paywall.

like i get that developers need to make money but come on, i just want to track some habits and see basic analytics without paying the price of netflix.

what ive tried:
- habitica - free but the whole RPG game thing is too much for me, i just want to track habits not battle monsters
- loop habit tracker - this one is actually decent and free but the UI looks like its from 2015 and the graphs are pretty basic
- streaks - not free, $5 which is reasonable but limited to 12 habits
- way of life - free version is too limited, cant even see decent stats
- done - free trial then wants $30/year

what im looking for:
- actually FREE or at least has a good free version (not a 7 day trial then paywall)
- can track unlimited habits or at least more than like 5
- has SOME analytics/graphs, not just checkmarks
- widgets would be great
- works on ios

is there anything out there that hits this or am i asking for too much? like i dont need every feature under the sun, i just want basic habit tracking with visual progress that doesnt cost me $100/year.

i keep seeing resolve mentioned and it looks like it has a free version with the core features? but cant tell if the free version is actually usable or one of those "technically free but you cant do anything" situations. anyone using the free version?

what are you guys using that doesnt require selling a kidney to afford?

## REPLY TEMPLATE (post from alt account 3-5 hours later):

so i've been using [Resolve](https://getresolveapp.com/app) for the past few months and the free version is actually pretty solid. like its not a trial, its genuinely free with the core features.

what you get in free version:
- unlimited habits (not capped at like 5 or 12)
- detailed graphs and analytics (this is what sold me - way better than loop's basic charts)
- focus timer to track actual work time
- journaling feature
- widgets

premium adds some extra stuff but honestly i used the free version for 2 months before upgrading and it was totally usable. i only upgraded because i wanted the extra analytics features, not because the free version was unusable.

the graphs are legit good even in free - you can see your completion percentages over time, patterns in when you're most consistent, how different habits correlate. way more detailed than habitica or loop.

also combines habits + focus tracking + journaling which means i deleted like 3 other apps. so even though i eventually paid for premium, im actually saving money because i cancelled my other subscriptions.

if you want completely free forever, loop habit tracker is probably your best bet but the UI really is rough. if you want free with option to upgrade later if you like it, resolve's free version is surprisingly good. been the first habit app that actually stuck for me.

try the free version for a week and see if it works for you. worst case you're out nothing since its actually free.
