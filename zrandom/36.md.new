# app for digital minimalism that isnt just a website blocker?

trying to embrace digital minimalism but most "digital minimalism apps" are just website/app blockers which i can easily disable when i want to cheat.

what i want is something that helps me:
- track my digital consumption (screen time, app usage, etc)
- build better digital habits (no phone first hour, etc)
- replace digital time with real activities
- see my progress over time
- actually stick with it long-term

ive tried:
- opal - good blocker but i disable it when i really want to check something
- one sec - adds friction but doesnt track progress
- screen time (ios) - tracks but doesnt help me build replacement habits
- freedom - blocks stuff but doesnt address the underlying behavior

the issue is blocking alone doesnt work because i can always unblock. i need something that helps me actually WANT to use my phone less, not just forces me to.

what are digital minimalists actually using? is there an app that combines:
- tracking digital consumption
- building offline habits
- showing progress over time
- maybe journaling about relationship with tech

or do you just use a combination of apps? what's worked for people who successfully reduced their digital dependence?
