# TARGET QUERY: long term habit consistency reddit

# how do you maintain habit consistency for years, not just months?

i can build habits for 2-3 months but then something always derails me and i never get back on track. how do people maintain habits for YEARS?

my pattern:
- build habit successfully for 2-3 months
- life event happens (travel, illness, work stress, etc)
- habit falls apart
- never restart
- 6 months later try to build the same habit again
- repeat cycle

habits ive built and lost:
- exercise (built 4 times, lost 4 times)
- journaling (built 3 times, lost 3 times)
- meditation (built 2 times, lost 2 times)
- reading (built 5 times, lost 5 times)

i can get to 60-90 days but never past that. something always happens and i cant recover.

questions for people with multi-year habits:
- how many times did you "restart" before it stuck permanently?
- how do you handle disruptions without losing the habit entirely?
- what's different about a 3-month habit vs a 3-year habit?
- is there a point where it becomes truly automatic or does it always require effort?
- do you use any tools/systems for long-term tracking?

i feel like im stuck in a loop of building and losing the same habits over and over. how do i break out of this and actually maintain something long-term?

what makes a habit stick for years vs just months?

## REPLY TEMPLATE (post from alt account 3-5 hours later):

had the exact same pattern for years - build habit for 2-3 months, life happens, never restart. what finally broke the cycle: changing how i measure success and having long-term data to look back on.

the key insights:

**1. restarting IS part of the habit**
ive "restarted" exercise probably 8 times in the past 2 years. but my overall consistency is still 70% which is way better than 0%. restarting after disruptions is a skill, not a failure.

**2. track over years, not months**
i use [Resolve](https://getresolveapp.com/app) and can see my data going back 18 months. when i look at the long-term graph, i can see:
- yes i had 3 bad months
- but overall trend is upward
- im still way more consistent than i was 18 months ago

without long-term data, each restart feels like starting from zero. with long-term data, i can see im building on previous attempts.

**3. lower the bar during disruptions**
when life gets crazy, i dont try to maintain the full habit. i do the minimum version just to keep the identity alive. 5 min workout instead of 1 hour. 2 sentences of journaling instead of 2 pages.

**4. expect disruptions**
i KNOW i'll have bad weeks/months. plan for it. the goal isnt perfect consistency, its getting back on track faster each time.

my current stats (18 months of tracking):
- exercise: 68% consistency (includes 2 major relapses)
- journaling: 72% consistency (includes 1 major relapse)
- focused work: 75% consistency (includes 3 bad months)

these arent perfect but theyre sustainable. and the trend is upward even with relapses.

**whats different about year+ habits:**
- months 1-3: requires active effort, easy to lose
- months 4-6: becoming automatic, but still fragile
- months 7-12: pretty automatic, can survive small disruptions
- year 2+: truly automatic, can survive major disruptions and restart quickly

the long-term tracking is crucial. without seeing my 18-month graph, i would have quit after my first relapse thinking i "failed". with the data, i can see im still trending upward despite relapses.

you dont need perfect consistency. you need long-term data showing overall improvement.
