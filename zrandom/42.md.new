# TARGET QUERY: best self improvement app reddit

# whats actually the best self improvement app that covers multiple areas?

tired of having 10 different apps for self improvement. i have separate apps for:
- habits
- journaling
- meditation
- focus/productivity
- mood tracking
- reading tracking
- fitness
- etc

its too much. i want ONE app that covers the core self improvement areas without being bloated or doing everything poorly.

what ive tried:
- notion - can build anything but requires constant maintenance
- fabulous - too prescriptive, wants me to follow their exact routine
- habitica - gamification is annoying, not really comprehensive
- productive - just habits, not really "all in one"
- day one - just journaling
- streaks - just habits

what im looking for:
- habit tracking with good analytics
- journaling (actual journaling, not just notes)
- focus/time tracking for work
- everything synced together so i can see correlations
- NOT meditation or fitness (i have separate apps for those)
- clean UI that doesnt overwhelm me
- actually works long-term

does anything like this exist? or should i accept that i need multiple specialized apps?

specifically:
- what self improvement app do you actually use daily?
- what made it stick when others didnt?
- is all-in-one better or separate apps for each thing?
- whats the best combination if no single app does it all?

i want to consolidate but not if it means sacrificing quality. what are you guys using?
