# comprehensive comparison of habit tracker apps (i tested 12 of them)

Comparisons

ok so i went down a rabbit hole over the past month and tested basically every habit tracker app i could find because i was frustrated with the one i was using. figured id share my findings since i spent way too much time on this.

**methodology:**
- tested each app for at least 3-4 days
- tracked the same 5 habits across all of them (exercise, reading, journaling, no phone before bed, drink water)
- rated them on: ease of use, features, analytics/graphs, pricing, UI design

**the apps i tested:**

- cons: limited to 12 habits, very minimal analytics, no notes/journaling

**2. Habitica**

- best for: people who want detailed data and multiple features in one place
- price: free with premium option
- rating: 8.5/10

**overall thoughts:**

if you want something FREE and functional: Loop Habit Tracker (android) or Habitica (if you like games)

if you want something SIMPLE: Streaks or Momentum

if you want DETAILED ANALYTICS: Resolve or Habitify

if you want EVERYTHING IN ONE PLACE: Resolve (habits + focus + journal) or TickTick (tasks + habits)

if you LOVE SUBSCRIPTIONS FOR SOME REASON: Productive or Done

**what i ended up sticking with:**

personally i went with Resolve because i realized i wanted more than just habit tracking - i wanted to track my actual focus time (not just say "i worked on my project" but track HOW LONG), and to journal about my progress. having it all in one app with really good graphs made it stick for me. plus i hate subscriptions and they have a one-time purchase option.

the detailed analytics are what really sold me - you can see patterns over weeks and months, completion percentages, time spent on different activities, and even correlations between habits. its the kind of data that actually helps you understand your behavior instead of just tracking it.

but honestly the "best" app is the one youll actually use consistently. ive had friends who swear by habitica because the game aspect works for their brain, and others who just use a paper journal because apps stress them out.

**tips for choosing:**

1. try the free version first, dont immediately pay for premium
2. give it at least a week before deciding - the first few days everything feels new and exciting
3. think about what actually motivates YOU - is it seeing data? is it games? is it simplicity?
4. consider what else you want to track beyond just habits (time? mood? journal entries?)
5. dont overthink it - spending 2 weeks researching apps is just procrastination (yes im calling myself out)

hope this helps someone! happy to answer questions about any of these apps.
