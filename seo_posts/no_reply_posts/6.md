my 60 day dopamine detox experience - what worked and what was total BS

Technique

you've probably seen all the dopamine detox videos on youtube. some of them are super extreme like "dont do ANYTHING enjoyable for 24 hours" which seems insane and not sustainable.

i wanted to do a dopamine detox but in a way that was actually realistic and could become a permanent lifestyle change, not just a 24 hour challenge.

here's what i did over 60 days and what actually made a difference:

"what i cut back on (not eliminated completely):"

- social media (instagram, tiktok, twitter)

- youtube (especially mindless watching)

- video games

- junk food

- porn

- news/doom scrolling

"the approach:"

instead of going cold turkey on everything, i used apps to limit and track my usage. the goal was to reduce high-dopamine activities by like 80%, not eliminate them completely.

"week 1-2: the setup"

- installed opal and one sec to add friction to social media apps

- set phone to grayscale mode after 8pm

- deleted tiktok and instagram from phone (could still access on computer)

- started tracking my screen time and focus time daily with Resolve (https://apps.apple.com/us/app/resolve-build-habits-focus/id6757266277)

the tracking was KEY. i needed to see actual data about my progress or i wouldnt stick with it. the app let me track both my "bad" habits (screen time, phone pickups) and my replacement habits (reading, focused work time, exercise). seeing those graphs side by side - screen time going down while focus time went up - was incredibly motivating.

results: felt super restless and bored. literally what do you even do if youre not scrolling? picked up my phone probably 200+ times a day out of habit.

"week 3-4: finding replacements"

this was KEY. you cant just remove dopamine sources and leave a void, your brain will rebel.

i replaced scrolling time with:

- reading (kept books everywhere - bedside, couch, backpack)

- going for walks (novel idea i know)

- actually working on my side projects

- calling friends instead of just texting

- cooking real meals instead of door dash

results: still felt restless at times but had things to DO. screen time dropped from 8 hours to 5 hours. focus time went from basically 0 to 2 hours per day.

"week 5-6: the shift"

around week 5 something clicked. i stopped constantly thinking about what i was "missing" on social media. started genuinely enjoying my walks and reading time instead of just doing them as replacement activities.

also started noticing that when i DID check social media (i allowed myself 30 min/day), it wasnt even that interesting? like i was addicted to the dopamine hit, not the actual content.

results: screen time down to 3 hours. focus time up to 4 hours. mood noticeably better.

"week 7-8: the plateau and temptations"

had a really stressful week at work and found myself reaching for comfort behaviors - tried to increase my social media time, ordered junk food, almost re-downloaded tiktok.

but because i had the app blockers and tracking in place, i could see the data showing me slipping. that awareness helped me course correct before fully falling off.

looking at my weekly review in the app, i could see my focus time had dropped from 4 hours to 2.5 hours and my phone pickups had increased. seeing those numbers made it real in a way that just "feeling" like i was slipping wouldnt have.

results: maintained around 3-4 hours screen time despite the stress. proved the systems work even when motivation is low.

"week 9+: the new normal"

by week 9 (day 60+), the lower-dopamine lifestyle started to feel normal. i still use social media but in specific time windows. still play video games but maybe 3 hours a week vs 3 hours a day.

"what actually worked:"

1. "tracking everything" - i tracked screen time, phone pickups, focus time, habits daily. you can't improve what you don't measure. having visual graphs showing my progress over weeks was the single biggest factor in sticking with this.

2. "adding friction, not blocking completely" - apps that make you wait 10 seconds before opening instagram work better than full blocks that you'll just disable.

3. "replacing, not just removing" - fill the time void with lower-dopamine but still enjoyable activities.

4. "being gradual" - going from 9 hours screen time to 2 hours overnight would have failed. doing it over 8 weeks was sustainable.

5. "having data to review" - looking at my weekly stats every sunday kept me accountable and showed progress even when it didnt "feel" like progress.

"what was BS:"

1. ""do nothing enjoyable for 24 hours"" - this is not sustainable and teaches you nothing about long-term behavior change.

2. ""your dopamine receptors will reset in X days"" - its not that simple, brains are complex, dont expect a magic reset.

3. ""you'll be super productive immediately"" - productivity came gradually as my attention span recovered, not overnight.

4. ""eliminate ALL dopamine"" - dopamine is necessary for life. the goal is to reduce excessive artificial dopamine, not eliminate pleasure.

"results after 60 days:"

- screen time: 9 hours/day → 2.5 hours/day

- phone pickups: ~200/day → ~65/day

- focus time: barely any → 4-5 hours/day

- books read: 0 in previous 6 months → 7 in these 60 days

- side project progress: had been "working on it" for a year → actually shipped it

- mood: anxious and scattered → noticeably calmer and more present

- sleep: midnight-7am → 10:30pm-6:30am

"ongoing maintenance:"

i still use app blockers and track my time because i know ill slip without systems. but it's way easier now that the habits are established.

current rules:

- social media only allowed 12pm-1pm and 7pm-8pm

- phone on grayscale after 8pm

- no phone first hour after waking

- track focus time daily

- weekly review of all stats

"biggest lesson:"

dopamine detox isnt about suffering or deprivation. its about resetting your baseline so that normal life feels satisfying again instead of boring compared to infinite scroll.

if your brain is constantly chasing high-dopamine hits, everything else feels like not enough. lower the baseline and suddenly a walk, a book, a real conversation, actually working on your goals - these things become genuinely enjoyable again.

would 100% recommend trying this if you feel like youre stuck in dopamine addiction. just do it gradually with systems and tracking, not cold turkey.
