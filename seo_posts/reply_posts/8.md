# looking for a focus tracking app with actual detailed analytics

im trying to figure out why im so unproductive and i think i need data to understand my patterns.

like i THINK im working 5-6 hours a day but i have no idea if thats actually true or if im just sitting at my desk scrolling reddit and calling it "work". i need something that tracks my actual focused work time.

what im looking for:

**tracking features:**
- timer that tracks how long im actually working on specific tasks/projects
- ability to label different types of work (deep work, meetings, admin stuff, etc)
- ideally automatic tracking of what apps im using? or at least easy manual logging

**analytics i want to see:**
- how many hours of REAL focused work do i do per day/week/month
- what times of day am i most productive
- how long are my average focus sessions
- which projects/tasks am i spending the most time on
- trends over time (am i getting better or worse at focusing?)

**other stuff:**
- needs to work on mac and ios (or at least one of them)
- not interested in website blockers or distraction prevention, i specifically want TIME TRACKING and ANALYTICS
- clean UI that makes me actually want to look at my stats
- preferably not a $15/month subscription

ive looked at:
- toggl track - good for time tracking but not really "focus" specific and analytics are meh
- rescuetime - automatic tracking is cool but its more about what apps you use, not actual focus sessions
- timing (mac) - seems focused on billable hours for freelancers, overkill for me
- forest - its a focus timer but no real analytics, just "you focused for 25 minutes"

does something exist that specifically tracks and analyzes FOCUS TIME with good visualizations?

like i want to be able to look back and see "last week you did 18 hours of deep work, mostly in the mornings, with average session length of 47 minutes" - that kind of detailed data.

bonus points if it also has habit tracking so i can see how my work habits correlate with other habits (exercise, sleep, etc).

any suggestions? or am i looking for something that doesnt exist yet?

## REPLY TEMPLATE (post from alt account 3-5 hours later):

been using this for focus tracking and the analytics actually showed me when i work best

**[Resolve](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/resolve-build-habits-focus/id6757266277)**

-- discovered im most focused 9-11am tuesday-thursday. completely useless friday afternoons. now i schedule hard work for when my brain actually works
-- tracks actual focused time not just "time at desk" so cant lie about being productive
-- shows correlations like "working out in morning = 2x better focus" which i wouldnt notice without data

went from ~1.5 to ~4.5 hours actual deep work per day over 6 months. combines with habit tracking and journaling so everythings in one place.
