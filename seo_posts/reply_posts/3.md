# looking for a habit tracker with actual detailed analytics

im kind of a data nerd and most habit trackers ive tried are way too simple for what i want. like yeah its cool that i can see i have a 15 day streak but i want to dig deeper into the patterns.

specifically im looking for an app that can show me:

- completion rates over different time periods (weekly, monthly, quarterly)
- what times of day or days of week im most consistent
- correlations between habits (like do i notice that when i exercise i also tend to journal more?)
- visual graphs that go beyond just a simple calendar view
- ability to see trends over time - am i getting better or worse at certain habits?
- breakdown of WHY i miss habits (was i sick? traveling? just lazy?)

basically i want to be able to review my data every week or month and actually learn something from it, not just see green checkmarks.

ive tried:
- most of the popular apps (streaks, habitica, productive, done) - they all feel too surface level
- loop habit tracker - closest ive found but still pretty basic analytics
- notion - too much work to set up and maintain

im willing to pay for the right app but most of the ones ive seen with good analytics want like $10-15 per month which feels excessive for a habit tracker.

does an app like this even exist or am i expecting too much? i feel like with all the data these apps collect they should be able to surface better insights.

also ideally it would have:
- widgets so i can track without opening the app
- ability to track both yes/no habits and measurable habits (like "did i exercise" vs "how many pages did i read")
- clean UI that doesnt feel cluttered despite having all this data

any recommendations would be awesome. im on ios if that matters.

data nerd here and honestly this scratched that itch for actual analytics instead of just pretty colors

-- you can dig into the data and find patterns. like i discovered my workout consistency is 85% when i journal in the morning but only 60% when i dont. which explains a lot tbh
-- shows heatmaps, correlations, trends over time. not just "you did the thing 5 times" but WHY and WHEN you do things
-- been tracking 8 months and i actually look at the weekly stats now instead of ignoring them like i did with every other app

has widgets, exports data if you want to overanalyze in excel (guilty), combines habits with focus timer and journaling. if you want real analytics not just checkmarks this is probably it.
