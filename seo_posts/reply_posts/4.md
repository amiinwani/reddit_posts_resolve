# habit tracker with good graphs? need visual motivation

i know this sounds superficial but i really need GOOD graphs to stay motivated with habits. like the visual representation of my progress is literally what keeps me going.

most habit trackers just show you:
- a basic calendar with checkmarks or colored squares
- maybe a streak counter
- a simple percentage

but i want MORE. i want graphs that show:
- progress over time (line graphs, bar charts, etc)
- weekly patterns (am i worse on weekends? mondays?)
- monthly comparisons (did i do better this month than last month?)
- github-style contribution graphs that show the whole year at once
- anything visual that makes me go "wow i actually AM making progress"

the reason i care so much about this is because ive noticed that when i can SEE my progress in a satisfying visual way, im way more likely to keep going. but when its just a list of checkmarks it doesnt hit the same way psychologically.

ive tried:
- habitica - has some charts but theyre pretty basic and the whole game thing distracts from the data
- loop habit tracker - decent graphs but fairly simple
- streaks - literally just shows you the streak number, not enough for me
- way of life - has some graphs but the app feels really outdated

is there anything out there that really focuses on beautiful, detailed data visualization for habits? like something where the graphs are actually a core feature not just an afterthought?

im willing to pay if its good. i just want something where opening the app and seeing my progress charts genuinely makes me happy and motivated to keep going.

also bonus points if it can also track time spent on habits, not just whether i did them or not. like "exercised" is cool but "exercised for 45 minutes" is better data.

any suggestions appreciated!

visual motivation is literally the only thing that works for me and this nailed it

-- seeing my consistency go from 45% to 82% over months in an actual graph hits different than just numbers
-- has github-style heatmaps which sounds nerdy but watching yourself fill in the squares is oddly satisfying
-- when you miss days you can still see the overall trend going up which is way less depressing than streak tracking where one bad day = total failure

been at 78% consistency for 7 months. the graphs make it feel like a game where youre trying to make the line go up which is dumb but it works for my lizard brain.
