# how long does it actually take to build a habit? my data from 6 months of tracking

Advice

everyone always says "21 days to build a habit" or "66 days" or some other random number but i wanted to actually see what it was like FOR ME with real data. so i tracked multiple habits over the past 6 months and here's what i learned.

**the habits i tracked:**

1. morning workout (started jan 1)
2. journaling (started jan 1)
3. reading before bed (started jan 15)
4. no phone first hour after waking (started feb 1)
5. drinking 8 glasses of water (started feb 15)

**what i found:**

it REALLY depends on the habit. they didnt all take the same time to become automatic.

**workout - took about 50 days to feel automatic**

- days 1-14: had to fight myself every single morning, needed alarms and pre-laid out clothes
- days 15-30: still required willpower but slightly less painful
- days 31-50: started to feel weird on days i DIDNT workout
- day 50+: genuinely automatic, i just do it without thinking

**journaling - took about 30 days**

- days 1-10: kept forgetting until bedtime
- days 11-25: started to remember but still felt like a chore
- day 25+: genuinely wanted to journal, felt incomplete without it

**reading - took about 40 days**

- days 1-20: would sometimes just scroll instead
- days 21-40: started reaching for book automatically
- day 40+: phone stays in other room, reading is my wind down routine

**no phone first hour - took about 75 days (still working on this)**

- days 1-30: failed constantly, maybe succeeded 40% of the time
- days 31-60: getting better, around 65% success rate
- day 60+: probably 80% consistent now but still not totally automatic

**drinking water - took about 20 days**

- days 1-7: kept forgetting
- days 8-20: had to use reminders
- day 20+: just automatic, i notice when i havent had water

**what i learned:**

**1. it depends on complexity and friction**

drinking water was easiest because its low friction - just grab bottle and drink. no phone first hour was hardest because it requires ongoing willpower throughout that hour, not just doing one thing.

**2. there are different stages**

- stage 1: constant willpower needed, easy to forget (days 1-14ish)
- stage 2: still requires effort but its on your radar (days 15-30ish)  
- stage 3: starting to feel natural but can still skip easily (days 31-50ish)
- stage 4: genuinely automatic, feels weird NOT to do it (day 50+)

**3. tracking helped WAY more than i expected**

i used [Resolve](https://getresolveapp.com/app) to track all of this and honestly seeing the graphs and streaks made a huge difference. when you can see "youve done this 47 days in a row" you really dont want to break that chain. also looking back at the data made me realize i WAS making progress even when it didnt feel like it.

**4. missing a day isnt the end of the world**

i missed days on all of these habits at various points. what mattered was getting back on track the next day instead of saying "welp i broke my streak, might as well quit".

the app i use shows completion percentage not just streak, so even if i broke a streak i could see i still had like 85% completion rate which kept me motivated.

**5. some habits never feel fully automatic**

no phone first hour still requires some conscious effort even after 75+ days. i think some habits are just like that - theyre fighting against strong existing patterns (in this case my phone addiction of 10+ years).

**6. building multiple habits at once is hard**

i started 2 habits at once in january and that was manageable. when i tried to add a 3rd and 4th in february it was rough. if i could do it again id space them out more - maybe start one new habit every 3-4 weeks.

**7. the "feeling" of automatic-ness varies**

workout feels automatic in that i just do it without debate, but i dont necessarily WANT to do it every day.

journaling feels automatic AND i genuinely want to do it.

drinking water i dont even think about, its just part of my day.

so "automatic" can mean different things.

**so how long does it ACTUALLY take?**

based on my experience: anywhere from 20-75 days depending on the habit, but most were in the 30-50 day range.

the "21 days" thing is BS. maybe for super simple habits but nothing meaningful became automatic that fast for me.

**tips if youre trying to build a habit:**

- track it visually so you can see your progress
- commit to at least 60 days before deciding if its "working"
- start with ONE habit at a time, maybe two max
- make it as easy as possible (remove friction)
- review your progress weekly
- dont beat yourself up for missing days, just get back on track
- celebrate milestones (30 days, 50 days, 100 days, etc)

**the most important thing:**

consistency over perfection. i didnt have a single habit where i had 100% completion. but 80-90% completion over months is what made them stick.

hope this helps someone whos wondering if theyre "building the habit fast enough" - youre probably doing fine, these things just take time.

happy to answer questions!
