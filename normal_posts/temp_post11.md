# digital dopamine detox tools that actually helped me reduce screen time from 9 hours to 2.5 hours

Technique

i was spending an embarrassing amount of time on my phone. like 8-9 hours a day, mostly on instagram, tiktok, twitter, and youtube. i knew it was bad but i just couldnt stop. every time i had a free moment - waiting in line, commercial break, even just walking between rooms - id pull out my phone.

tried a bunch of "just delete social media" advice but id always redownload within a day or two. clearly i needed more structure and help.

heres what actually worked for me over the past 3 months:

**1. opal (ios)**

this was my main app blocker and honestly it worked way better than the built in screen time because you cant just override it easily. i set it to block all social media during work hours (9am-5pm) and after 9pm. yes you CAN disable it but it makes you wait 15 seconds while showing you your screen time stats which is usually enough to make me reconsider.

the forced breathing exercise before unblocking is lowkey genius - gives your brain time to realize youre just bored, not actually needing to check instagram.

**2. one sec (ios)**

this was AMAZING for breaking the autopilot phone checking. basically adds a delay + breathing exercise before you can open apps you specify. sounds simple but its so effective because most of my phone usage was just muscle memory - id unlock my phone and tap instagram without even thinking.

the delay breaks that automatic behavior and makes you conscious of what youre doing. half the time id realize i didnt actually want to open the app, i was just bored.

**3. clearspace (android)**

similar concept to one sec but i used this when i had an android for a bit. adds intentional friction before opening apps. also has good stats about how many times you tried to open blocked apps which is eye opening.

**4. focus timer in resolve**

ok so this is technically not a "blocker" but hear me out - part of my phone addiction was that i wasnt actually DOING anything else. i realized that actively tracking what i was working on made me way less likely to get distracted.

i started using the focus timer in [Resolve](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/resolve-build-habits-focus/id6757266277) to track deep work sessions. something about having an active timer running made me not want to break my focus to check my phone. plus it gamified actually being productive instead of just blocking distractions.

it also shows you graphs of your focus time over weeks which was motivating - seeing that i went from 1 hour of real focused time per day to 4-5 hours made me want to keep going.

**5. grayscale mode**

not an app but a built-in feature on both ios and android. making your phone black and white makes it SO much less appealing to use. instagram is way less addictive when you cant see the colors.

i set it to automatically turn on at 8pm and turn off at 8am. evenings and mornings were my worst doom scrolling times so this helped a lot.

price: free (built in)

**6. freedom**

tried this for blocking websites on my computer. worked well but i found i could just use my phone instead so it wasnt a complete solution. but if you combine it with phone blockers it can be effective.

price: subscription based
rating: 6/10 (works but overpriced)

**what didnt work for me:**

- forest app - i dont care about virtual trees, didnt motivate me at all
- just using built-in screen time - too easy to bypass
- going full cold turkey and deleting everything - lasted 2 days max before anxiety made me redownload
- trying to rely on willpower alone - willpower runs out by 2pm for me

**my current system:**

- opal blocks social media during work hours and after 9pm
- one sec adds delays to instagram, tiktok, youtube (the big time wasters)
- grayscale turns on automatically at 8pm
- focus timer when im working on anything important (work, projects, studying)
- phone on do not disturb by default, only certain contacts can get through
- phone charges in a different room at night (this was HUGE for my sleep)

**results after 3 months:**

- screen time went from 8-9 hours to 2-3 hours average
- phone pickups went from ~200/day to ~60/day
- sleep improved dramatically (was falling asleep at midnight scrolling, now asleep by 10:30)
- actually reading books again (finished 8 books in 3 months vs 2 books the entire previous year)
- weirdly less anxious? i think the constant doom scrolling was feeding my anxiety

**biggest lessons:**

1. you need MULTIPLE tools working together. one app blocker isnt enough.

2. add friction to bad habits, remove friction from good habits. make it annoying to open instagram but easy to open kindle.

3. replace the phone time with something else or youll just be bored and give up. for me it was reading, projects, and actually being present with people.

4. dont go all or nothing. i still use social media, just in limited time windows. complete restriction made me obsess over it more.

5. tracking your actual productive time (not just blocking distractions) was surprisingly effective. gave me something to focus ON instead of just things to avoid.

6. be patient with yourself. first week was HARD. i felt super anxious and kept trying to bypass my own blockers. but it got way easier after about 2 weeks.

if youre struggling with phone addiction i really recommend trying a combination of these tools for at least 2-3 weeks. the first few days suck but then your brain adjusts and you stop craving the constant stimulation.

happy to answer questions about any of these tools or the process!
