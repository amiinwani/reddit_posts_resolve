# tried 15+ self improvement apps, heres what actually worked for me

Advice

so ive been on this whole self improvement journey for about 2 years now and ive basically tried every app under the sun. some were complete garbage, some were ok, and a couple actually made a real difference. figured id share my experience since i wasted a lot of time and money figuring this out.

**the ones that didnt work (for me at least):**

- apps that tried to do everything - meditation, habits, goals, journaling, fitness tracking, meal planning. they sound great in theory but theyre so bloated that i never actually used 90% of the features and it just felt overwhelming
- anything with a super aggressive paywall - like you download it and cant do ANYTHING without subscribing. instant delete
- apps with toxic productivity culture vibes - you know the ones where its like "wake up at 4am! cold showers! be a LION not a SHEEP!" yeah those just made me feel bad about myself
- gamification apps where you battle monsters or whatever - i know some people love habitica but for me it was just extra noise

**what i learned actually matters:**

**1. you need to see progress visually** - this was huge for me. apps that just had a list of checkmarks didnt motivate me at all. but when i could see graphs and streaks and patterns over time, it clicked. our brains are visual and seeing that progress chart go up hits different than just knowing intellectually that youve done something 10 days in a row.

**2. less is more with features** - the apps i stuck with did like 2-3 things really well instead of 50 things poorly. i'd rather have an amazing habit tracker than a mediocre habit tracker + mediocre meditation timer + mediocre journal.

**3. friction is the enemy** - if it takes more than 2 taps to log something, i wont do it consistently. the best apps ive used have widgets, shortcuts, and make it absurdly easy to track stuff.

**4. you need SOME accountability** - whether thats seeing your streak, or having data you can review weekly, or even just the app asking "hey you havent logged today". complete freedom meant i just...didnt do it.

**my current setup that actually works:**

for habits and focus tracking, i use [Resolve](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/resolve-build-habits-focus/id6757266277) - its one of those newer apps that combines habit tracking with a focus timer and journaling. the thing i love about it is the graphs are actually detailed (you can see patterns over weeks/months), it tracks how much time you actually spend working vs just saying you worked, and the journaling is flexible (you can type, voice record, or just add images). no annoying gamification, just clean data and visual progress.

for reading, i just use the built-in books app and goodreads. nothing fancy needed there.

for fitness, i use the basic apple fitness/health app because i dont need anything complicated, just step counts and workout logging.

**actual tips that helped me stick with it:**

- start with like 2-3 habits max, not 15. i was way too ambitious at first
- review your progress every sunday. i set a recurring calendar event and actually look at my data for 10 minutes. its motivating and helps me adjust
- dont beat yourself up for missing days. the app will show you that you still have like an 80% completion rate which is WAY better than 0%
- pair habit tracking with something you already do (i check my habits right after my morning coffee)
- if an app stresses you out or feels like a chore, DELETE IT. the point is to improve your life not add more anxiety

honestly the biggest game changer was when i stopped looking for the "perfect" app and just committed to ONE system for at least 30 days. you can have the best app in the world but if you dont actually use it consistently it doesnt matter.

hope this helps someone whos in the same boat i was in! happy to answer questions about any specific apps ive tried.
