OK OUR GOAL RIGHT NOW IS TO CREATE  POSTS IN THE SELF DEVELOPMENT NICHE SUCH THAT THEY CAN GO VIRAL AND IN THIS IT IS OUR GOAL TO PROMOTE OUR MOBILE APP THAT HELPED THEM DO SO BUT THIS POST SHOULD NOT AT ALL LOOK LIKE A PROMPTION OF THE APP THE PROMOTION SHOULD BE QUITE NON OBVIOUS YET HIGHLY CONVERTING TO OUR APP 

*FOLDER AND SAVING RULES*
YOU JOB IS TO GO AHEAD AND CREATE 10 POSTS IN THE @no_reply_posts 
EACH WITH ITS OWN NAM ELIKE POST1.MD POST2.MD 
- IF THERE ARE ALREADY SOME POSTS IN THERE CAHNGE THERE NAME AND MAKE THEM ALL ORGAINIZED FOROM 1 TO WHATEVER NUMBER THERE 
- AND THEN START FROM THERE AND CREATE THE REST OF THE NEW 10 POSTS AND SAVE THEM IN THERE STARGING FROM THAT NUMBERING OF THE POST THAT ARE ALREADY THERE, IF THERE ARE NONE START FROM POST1 POST2 AND ON 

*POST CREATION RULES *
FOR EACH OF THE POST IT SHOULD HAVE A TITLE 
-Not perfectly capitalized or grammatically clean  
- Include curiosity + value + slight imperfection 
-Avoid cringe or overhype 
- It should look real and authentic and draw the reader in for more, take in the example posts in as context and understand better from that 

FORMATTING 
- use reddit formatting not the standard markdown formatting 
- it should have inconsistent mark down it should not be perfectly symetrical, but it should have mark down but not too much 

LINKING STRATEGY 
- NEVER show the same link version in consecutive posts
- here are the different link versions : 
a. https://getresolveapp.com/app 
b. https://apps.apple.com/us/app/resolve-build-habits-focus/id6757266277 
c. https://sat.curiolearn.co/resovel
d. https://arhamamin.com/resolve 
- Create multiple redirect URLs that point to your main domain
Use casual language like "I've been using these guys" followed by link
Every 4th post: NO hyperlink - just mention the domain name with brackets: productname[.]com
